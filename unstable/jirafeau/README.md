*Simple and secure Wallabag container based on Alpine Linux*

### What is wallabag ?
[Wallabag](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag) is a self hostable application for saving web pages, freely.

### Goal of this container
Propose a lightweight and secure container that is easy to setup. There is no confirmation email and I'm using the sqlite database.  
**Warning:** Support for SQLite is being [dropped](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/2766) by Wallabag in the [future](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/2766#issuecomment-352359471) (or maybe [later](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/2766#issuecomment-490918115)). Since I don't really care about migrating my articles and I don't want to add a full-fledge database for this service, I'll do migrations [manually](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/4126).  
**Warning:** This container will stay on alpine 3.9 until wallabag 2.4 ([php 7.3 is not supported by 2.3.x](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues/3899)).
