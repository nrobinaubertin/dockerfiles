            <p class=quote>Power node isolated - Female announcer</p>
            <p>From the many gametypes UT2004 offers, onslaught is the most popular one. It 
                features vehicles, nodes, action, turrets, weapons and more action. Figuring 
                out where to go is a part of the game, but if things take too long, you're useless 
                to your team.</p>
            <p>This is where I come in. On this page, I'll overview the layout of the levels 
                and how it should be played (IMO, of course). This won't cover the basics of 
                onslaught; there are plenty of guides on this subject already, so study them 
                if you're unfamiliar with them.<br>
                Next point: the illustrations used are made by Kurt 'KurlonT' Rodriguez. He 
                has made some extra ones for the <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/cbp/">Community 
                    Bonus Pack 2</a> and the <a href="http://download.beyondunreal.com/fileworks.php/official/ut2004/ut2004-ecebonuspack1-1.exe">ECE 
                    maps</a> as well...you can find these pics <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/ut2004/onslaughtmaps/"> 
                    here</a> and <a href="http://www.beyondunreal.com/content/articles/89_1.php">here</a>. 
                The described maps here cover the non-ECE version of the maps.<br>
                Finally: I will only cover the default link setup. Other link setups require 
                other approaches, so be flexible, will ya?<br>
                Good. Let's get started...</p>
            <h2><a name="ArcticStronghold"></a>ArcticStronghold</h2>
            <p><img src="pics/arcticstronghold.jpg" width="808" height="588"></p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                Positioned in a snowy location, this map provides a great deal of Z-axis due 
                to the many hills and ridges. This makes it hard to drive around, so get to 
                know where each road goes to. ArcticStronghold isn't a big level, but the differences 
                in height will make it hard to travel from A to B.</p>
            <p><b>Match description:</b><b><br>
                </b>Both bases are located close to their first node; you reach it by going 
                to your right after the first slope when you exit your base. This first node 
                has 2 turrets: one near the bridge and one behind the node; this one can only 
                be reached from the power core.<br>
                After setting up the first node, you can keep going straight and you'll end 
                up at the next node. Red team comes across the node on their path (nr 3). It's 
                almost hidden behind a small hill and has a bit of height advantage. Blue team 
                must cross a ski-run to get to node nr 2. Both nodes are located close to the 
                enemy base, but some sharp peaks block the way. These can be overcome if they 
                have to: blue can climb to the left from the base and red even has a tunnel.<br>
                But these are stealth routes; the main combat will take place in the big valley 
                below, which crosses the map in an 'S'-shape from point 3 to 2. Node 5 lies 
                below the bridge. This node has the best goodies, including a tank and 4 turrets! 
                The best item is undoubtedly the redeemer, located on the small edge near the 
                node. You can reach it with a shield jump, but it's preferred to drop down from 
                above (there's a jump pad near the node) or use a manta or raptor.<br>
                The fact that this point lies closer to the red base than blue's base has advantages 
                and disadvantages. Red can claim the node first, but they have to make quite 
                a detour to reach blue's first node.</p>
            <p>Personally, I don't like the default link setup. The turrets are hard to reach 
                and the slopes allow for easy sneak attacks. And that's too bad, because you 
                really need to defend your first node. On many occasions, the match is even 
                decided once the first node goes down. Sure, the other team can swarm the node 
                with a big amount of vehicles and infantry, but in the mean time, the other 
                team takes control of all 3 nodes, which is extremely hard to come back from.<br>
                Comebacks are easy <i>in theory</i>: take back the node, cover the place with 
                spider mines and man the turrets. Then split the team in two: one group takes 
                back one node (preferrably the center one, to prevent redeemer launches), and 
                then immediately proceed by tearing down <i>their</i> first node. In reality, 
                attackers simply spawn from a node that <i>isn't</i> under attack and keep the 
                pressure on your first node, no matter how many defenders you have (which is 
                always too low).<br>
                The 'up' team hasn't won yet: each base has 4 turrets, which can provide decent 
                coverage for everything that tries to get to the base or the first node.</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The best way to deal much damage to the power core is to get manta's in 
                    there. There's no shock rifle among the starting kit, which makes it extremely 
                    hard for defenders to stop the assault</li>
                <li>It doesn't matter which second node you take first (even though the center 
                    one has the best stuff), but it does matter which node you <i>keep </i>long 
                    enough to destroy their first node. Don't waste efforts on taking down sidenodes 
                    if their first node is vulnerable.</li>
                <li>if things get too rough on the first node, then try to carjack abandoned 
                    vehicles. As long as you're driving around in one, they won't have access 
                    to it.</li>
                <li>don't leave the provided roads unless you <i>really</i> know where you're 
                    going. It's better to take a detour than trying too hard to cross that one 
                    challenging peak.</li>
                <li>Don't forget that your base spawns a tank. Bring it over the bridge to keep 
                    attackers away from their first node.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="Crossfire"></a>Crossfire</h2>
            <p><img src="pics/crossfire.jpg" width="775" height="668"></p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                Crossfire consists of high ruins and pillars that are scattered around one big 
                mountain. These ruins don't make real obstacles; you can easily get around them. 
                They do provide some good coverage for infantry, though. With some practice 
                you can jump from building to building and pick up some nice things along the 
                way. Navigating your vehicles can be tough, but it's certainly easier than on 
                ArcticStronghold. Raptors can be a real pain because they have an abundance 
                of stuff to hide behind.</p>
            <p><b>Match description:</b><br>
                From your base, the shortest way to your first node is to take the left route, 
                between the volcano and the side of the level. This is quite a long trip, so 
                share that manta and scorpion. The hellbender, is set up to drive to the top 
                (it can get to the first node as well, but this should be covered by the rest 
                of your team).<br>
                The best way to win on this map is by securing the center node. It's also the 
                easiest to find among those ruins: just proceed uphill. The height advantage 
                is good, but enemies can come from almost every direction. Besides its location, 
                it also offers easy access to a variety of power-ups. The damage amp is best 
                used to defend the place, and if you check the map, you can find the ion painter, 
                target painter <i>and</i> the redeemer within walking distance (the redeemer 
                is on an edge slightly below the building), ready to take out the tank nodes 
                (5 and 7).<br>
                These tank nodes provide the best resources to conquer the top, by the way. 
                Make sure you don't forget about this side of the battlefield. When heading 
                for opponents' nodes, just follow the colored beams. They stick out nice against 
                all the brownish scenery.<br>
                The power cores have a reasonable surrounding from the rest of the level, but 
                there is no way it can seriously stop attacks from the hill. Take back your 
                first node as fast as you can, because the turrets can only hold up attackers; 
                they can't stop them.</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>don't launch your attack on the power core from their first node: it's vehicles 
                    are too weak. Use the tanks to drive on the scenery to hit the power core 
                    from afar, or to simply pick on attacking enemies.</li>
                <li>use raptors and manta's to get to the superweapons, and use these to take 
                    out the center node (if it isn't yours).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="Dawn"></a>Dawn</h2>
            <p><img src="pics/dawn.jpg" width="642" height="766"></p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                This map is easy to describe: two gigantic ellipses inside each other, the inner 
                one just somewhat lower than the outer. There's an entrance to the center on 
                each point of the compass.<br>
                Nodes are out in the open, though surrounded by some sort of wall, which prevents 
                attacks from far range.<br>
                Each base has 2 first nodes: one close one to your left and one to your right, 
                which lies a bit further. The two center ones are connected, have a turret for 
                protection and are really close to each other.<br>
                And then there are the bases. The turrets at the entrance can really reach out 
                for enemy's (they can almost defend the nearby nodes as well) so manning them 
                is a good idea if the core is vulnerable. Inside is a third turret, but this 
                can be avoided a lot better if the attackers stay on the surroundings of the 
                base. </p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                Make sure your team starts out on both sides towards the nodes. After that, 
                the big fight for the center nodes start. It's the best if you can secure both 
                points before advancing toward one of their first nodes, but this usually won't 
                work. If a center node isn't in danger for 10 seconds, it means the tank is 
                still underway.<br>
                At a certain moment, you'll have to agree on your team to take a risk and focus 
                on one side of the map and focus on one of their vulnerable nodes. At this moment, 
                put the speed on things. Team up a tank and a fast vehicle. Let the tank destroy 
                the node and let the other player quickly take over the place, while the tank 
                stands guard. After that, immediately start the attack on the power core. About 
                half your team should worry about the center: keep their center node up, and 
                - if possible - locked.<br>
                The other team can come back easy by destroying their center node. Taking back 
                their lost first node is also possible, and in many occasions even easier to 
                reach with the base tank.</p>
            <p>The 'quick attack on one side' strategy doesn't guarantee a straight win (unless 
                the other team decides a mass defence of the base), but gives an important edge 
                when the game goes in overtime. It's easy to maintain a status quo on the middle 
                and this is always in the advantage of the team that has the most health in 
                their core left.</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>you can reach the raptor in the base fast by double jumping to the lamp 
                    underneath, and then another double jump to the landing platform.</li>
                <li>don't forget about the target painter and the redeemer! The redeemer is 
                    hidden in a crashed vehicle, the target painter somewhere in the bushes.</li>
                <li>long range fire is a real threat on this map, especially from tanks. Tanks 
                    can even aim at both center nodes from the side entrances to the center valley.</li>
                <li>raptors shouldn't fly too high, as they can be seen from virtually everywhere. 
                    Stay low and keep an eye out for tanks and unguarded nodes.</li>
                <li>the distances are pretty big in this map, so don't travel between nodes 
                    on foot (except between the center ones).</li>
                <li>the hills that make out the border of the valley can be climbed for some 
                    good sniping with AVRiL's. Even tanks can be some good use up there</li>
                <li>Infantry will probably be a bad choice though. It's a real long way to walk 
                    somewhere, and you're very vulnerable in here. So please, either transport 
                    to the next node or wait if there are no vehicles. Only between the middle 
                    nodes you can walk back and front on foot.</li>

            <h2><a name="Dria"></a>Dria</h2>
            <p><img src="pics/dria.jpg" width="808" height="587"></p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                Four ruins, four houses, two bridges that cross a big frozen lake, many trees 
                that provide camouflage, a few hills and some sort of Chinese wall that, together 
                with the frozen lake, splits the map into four segments. And believe it or not, 
                but there is <i>still</i> a lot of open space. As you can imagine, Dria is huge.</p>
            <p><b>Match description:</b><br>
                Players start out in a large ruins, with plenty of protection from the place 
                and the nearby hill. The power core is somewhat on the open, though, so keep 
                the shield up. You start out with plenty of fast vehicles, so you should be 
                able to get everywhere without carpooling or having to walk anywhere. Spread 
                out, so both the first node as both the second nodes are covered. In my experience, 
                the raptor is the best choice to get to the tank node (node 3 or 8).<br>
                Both the river nodes (1 or 6) and the tank nodes consist of broken down houses. 
                These houses provide reasonable coverage for infantry, but the node can be seen 
                (and shot) from large distances.<br>
                The tank nodes are pretty close to each other, so expect quite some fireworks 
                in this area. It's usually a good idea to man the turrets at the bridge entrance.<br>
                The Chinese wall separates the battlefield, making backup (both in offence and 
                defence) very hard. Keep your team split into four parts: 2 parts take care 
                of the defence of the nodes, while the other 2 use fast vehicles to try to break 
                down the nodes on the other side of the river.<br>
                As soon as a second node gets captured, the other team must fall back to the 
                first node (previous defenders of that node now start defending the first node, 
                and the attack squad that now has a locked node as target now try to take back 
                their destroyed first node). Due to the large distances between nodes, comebacks 
                are still possible at this point...<br>
                Things get worse once the first node falls. Attackers only have to keep that 
                first node down, while all the adjacent nodes start draining and the rest of 
                their team abandones the defense to take over all these isolated nodes. All 
                defenders should focus on getting that first node back (except maybe one or 
                two that keep guard at the remaining second node); on occasions, they should 
                even suicide to quickly get back to the main base.<br>
                The game is practically over when both second nodes are conquered. The losing 
                team has to split up their attackers while keeping a good defense at the first 
                node, while the other team can swarm over from two nodes. The large distances 
                make it almost impossible to come back in the game. All that the losing team 
                can do is delay the enemies as long as possible. And since the power core holds 
                a big amount of vehicles, they can do this very easy.<br>
                If the team can take over the first node, they shouldn't forget to defend it 
                well, as there will be a huge amount of enemies heading that way. Also: don't 
                forget the power core can be attacked both from the river node and the first 
                node. </p>
            <p>Now...you might have noticed that I skipped over the second ruins. The reason 
                is that these don't live up to the pace and usefullness of the game. They don't 
                provide an additional route, and are too far away to be of essential use in 
                the game. It's not a bad idea to get there from the tank node with an airborne 
                vehicle, touch it and proceed to attack the opposing river node (never link 
                up this node!!!). This provides a somewhat better attack position, but for this 
                to work, you have to be able to rely on your defensive force at the tank node, 
                and this is a rare occasion. Whenever the adjacent node falls, you have an additional 
                way to go get it back, but you're fighting against the time, as your node will 
                drain quickly and that adjacent node is quite far away.<br>
                Taking that node when you're on the offense is a better idea (when you already 
                have <i>both</i> their second nodes). In this case, it will provide for an extra 
                position to attack the first node from...a location <i>that can't be attacked 
                    directly</i>.</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> red's river node (node 1) lies further away from the tank nodes than blue's 
                    river node. This can put more pressure on red's tank node, but don't forget 
                    that tanks can also wander off to destroy blue's river node.</li>
                <li>never leave your nodes undefended: if it gets under attack it will be broken, 
                    because defenders must travel a big deal to get there (assuming that someone 
                    will try to keep the node up)</li>
                <li>every node holds an AVRiL. In combination with the open grounds, it can 
                    make infantry a feared defender</li>
                <li>if you can get on the towers on top of the bridge (where the lightning gun 
                    is), you can take clear shots at either tank node</li>
                <li>a good manta driver can hop in the houses on the second nodes, quickly clearing 
                    all the infantry inside</li>
                <li>when using their speed and some debris, manta's can make it over the Chinese 
                    wall</li>
                <li>the second ruins contains a target painter on top of the tower, but I haven't 
                    seen a good use of it so far</li>

            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                This map is small, dark and icy, finished with 3 tall castles. In front of each 
                castle is an open space that serves as a parking lot for the vehicles. Each 
                base is connected to the central node by a narrow riverbed with some steep hills 
                on the side. The alternative route to the node goes over the side, but this 
                is longer and harder to travel.</p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                Most of the fighting takes place in front of the node. Vehicles will fight each 
                other in front of the castle and on the outskirts of the riverbed. Make sure 
                to keep the enemy tank at bay, or all your efforts in claiming the node will 
                be in vain.<br>
                Meanwhile, the ground troops hide in and nearby the castle. There are teleporters 
                to get a height advantage, and a couple great power-ups to maintain your status. 
                Infantry that have taken the long way can even pick up spider mines and grenades 
                from the side nodes (node 1 or 2), which can be of great use here. This is all 
                close combat, so bring in good reflexes.<br>
                The hill overlooking the castle contains a target painter. Airborne vehicles 
                can grab the target painter the fastest, but the platform isn't fit for a proper 
                landing, so you often lose your vehicle while doing so. Both sides have a spot 
                where infantry can <a href="movement.html#Basic">slopedodge</a> to reach the 
                top of the hill.<br>
                Claiming the node is only half the battle. Man the turret, and be on the lookout 
                for incoming enemies. Ground vehicles or infantry rarely make it close to the 
                enemy base, so use airborne vehicles instead. The power node is very well-protected 
                by the castle, so be carefull...</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>try to carjack their stuff to deny them their own vehicles</li>
                <li>use your raptor to scout and take on the enemy tank</li>
                <li>keep your tank away from the center node square, but be able to shoot at 
                    everything that drives on it. Especially blue has a good spot: they can park 
                    their tank and take out the node relatively safe. This makes the node harder 
                    to hold for the red team, but red team can defend it a lot easier <i>if</i> 
                    they can control the node</li>
                <li>when attacking the power core, make sure to cover it with grenades. Put 
                    the power core as a shield between you and the enemies, and detonate the grenades 
                    whenever they come too close to them</li>

            <p><img src="pics/primeval.jpg" width="620" height="567"></p>
            <p><b>Story introduction:</b><br>
                Ah...nature; the pure sound of singing birds and that smell of gigantic trees. 
                It's really calming, refreshing and ...what? We lost the center? we <b><i>lost 
                        the center??!?</i></b> Aaaargh. Bring out the guns and load up the hellbender, 
                <i>ASAP</i>! It's time to...to...ehm...Ah, heck. Shoot anything that moves!</p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                Being one of the smallest maps, Primeval matches go extremely fast if teams 
                are unbalanced either by skill or by players. Even with a right roundup, it's 
                a game where the tide can turn fast. These tips might just push the balance 
                to your advantage.<br>
                In layout, Primeval resembles a reversed capital 'B' with only minimal height 
                difference. The side node lies really close to the power core. Ironical enough, 
                this node is reached the fastest on foot, since the shortest route is a narrow 
                passway. The passway can be passed with a manta and (if you're carefull) a scorpion; 
                <i>don't</i> try it with anything else!<br>
                The central node is slightly closer to the sidenode than to the power core, 
                but it can be reached by both sides with ease.</p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                Make sure the hellbender is completely filled and that the scorpion has (at 
                least) one passenger on top before heading toward the center. Any remaining 
                infantry should take the pathway to the sidenode and link it up. This node is 
                really necessary to perform a decent attack on the center node, because you 
                will need all the force you can get to control it.<br>
                There will be action in the center node for the entire length of the match; 
                everyone will be busy combo-ing skymines, throwing spidermines or shooting rockets, 
                usually in the direction of the enemies' territory. If you are unfamiliar with 
                the concept of spamming, then you'll learn about it soon enough. It simply comes 
                down to shoot more amounts and more powerfull stuff at them than they can throw 
                back.<br>
                Taking control of the center node will take a while, let alone <i>building</i> 
                it. Stay out of sight while you link up, and make sure to double-, triple- and 
                even quatriplelink to team mates that are trying to set up the node. Once the 
                center node is set up, things get easier. The tank is a very helpfull tool on 
                this level, so make sure you keep it in working condition. Therefore, it's best 
                to drive it back to your own territory, and pick on enemy infantry at the center 
                from far away.<br>
                The fight is far from over, though. It isn't easy to infiltrate the enemy base, 
                because about the entire team spawns there. On many occasions, it's even a good 
                idea to focus on their sidenode first (using fast vehicles): if you can take 
                it down, the defending team has less vehicles. And if you can put your own node 
                up, you can attack the power core from 2 sides.</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>the link gun is a crucial part to win the match; mostly to link up and maintain 
                    the center node, but also to repair the tank when needed. Node defenders can 
                    spend entire matches linking up stuff</li>
                <li>if your team is in control of the enemies' side node, block the passageway 
                    with spider mines</li>
                <li>bring spidermines to the center: use them to slow down assaults while you 
                    remain on a safe distance</li>
                <li>there aren't many vehicles in this map, so use the ones you have wisely</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="RedPlanet"></a>RedPlanet</h2>
            <p><img src="pics/redplanet.jpg" width="813" height="700"></p>
            <p><b>Overview:<br>
                </b>This enormous map might be smaller than Dria, but it sure isn't fit for 
                walking around in. Long, broad plains and huge mountaintops make you feel really 
                small in this level. The firepower adds to that illusion, since each base starts 
                off with nothing less than a leviathan!<br>
                Each node is a fortress, guarded with 4 turrets. This allows for some great 
                defense...assuming someone is going to defend.</p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                This map is just too big to get to more than one destination, so spread out 
                your team. Send an airborne vehicle toward the first node, and the leviathan 
                through the main gate in the direction of the center node, with <i>at least</i> 
                an extra person following him. Also, make someone start out going to the left 
                sidenode (5 for red, 2 for blue), because that node gets out of reach once you 
                get to the other nodes. All other players can provide backup for either group.<br>
                Going straight from the first node brings you toward the right sidenode (2 for 
                red, 5 for blue). Forget about the target painter; the place is too big for 
                a decent bombardment, and the nodes are located indoors.<br>
                Meanwhile, the main action will take place on the center node: it's the easiest 
                to reach, and provides the shortest path to the opponents' first node. Keep 
                in mind that the huge rocks on the side prevent you to go defend a side node 
                that's under attack, so you better push straight through to their first one.<br>
                While the action goes on between the three nodes, don't forget about your own 
                defenses. It's unlikely that your team will control all 3 nodes, so keep your 
                first node guarded as long as it's vulnerable.<br>
                When their first node falls, make it your priority to capture all other central 
                nodes <i>before</i> focussing on the power core. If you manage to capture the 
                node, guard it well: enemies will swarm in from wherever they have nodes.</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>keep mental notes on the positions of the levi's. Back them up with AVRiL's 
                    and repair them when needed.<br>
                </li>
                <li>just because you can gather a better fleet than your opponents doesn't make 
                    you the winner of this map: three nodes are impossible to defend. Manta's 
                    and raptors can take over undefended nodes before backup can come in (this 
                    map is huge, remember?). Therefore, you need defense on the first node when 
                    the enemy team is even just <i>building</i> a node.<br>
                </li>
                <li>I don't know why the weapon lockers contain normal sniper rifles, but I 
                    suggest you stick to turrets for sniping. It's 'just a little' better against 
                    vehicles </li>
                <li>take out turrets while coming close to a node, unless you have more urgent 
                    concerns. They can see <i>a lot</i>, so don't neglect them<br>
                </li>
                <li>When in a manta, don't try to crush people that are standing on a node. 
                    The peaks will make your vehicle stuck</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="Severance"></a>Severance</h2>
            <p><b><img src="pics/severance.jpg" width="745" height="654"></b></p>
            <p><b>Story introduction:</b><br>
                3...2...1...fight! I spawn near the manta, and run to it like hell. I immediately 
                get in and fly off. Oops, I ran over my teammate...luckily team damage is off. 
                Why was he heading my way in the first place? I make my way over the ruins and 
                head for the node. There's a raptor slightly ahead of me but I don't give up. 
                He stops to land! Yes, I win! I drive over the node at full speed and jump out 
                at exact the right time. Then I realize I don't have weapons. By the time I 
                picked up the weapon locker, the raptor driver is already linking up. I <i>could</i> 
                link up to him, but that wouldn't give me personal credit. So I just link up 
                to the node instead.<br>
                Okay...that node is set up before theirs. Now where is my manta? Ah, nevermind. 
                There's a fresh one right here. Raptor boy and me start off at the same time, 
                both of us heading for that node behind the bridge. While linking up the second 
                node I notice that the other team must be cheating! They finished their first 
                node <i>after</i> us, but finished their second one <i>before</i> us. Do they 
                really think I didn't saw that? I quickly let them know by broadcasting '<i>OMG 
                    Cheats!!! u suxxorrs!!!1!1!one</i>'<br>
                By this time, our second node is built. Luckily, one of your players is already 
                in the center, and the center node starts building. Yes! We won the race :-)<br>
                Quickly, raptor boy and me grab new vehicles and head to the carnage in the 
                center. Hah, one of theirs even runs off by the sight of our firepower! Shortly 
                after that, we claim our prize: one BIG tank! I knew where it was gonna spawn, 
                so I'm already close by. A team mate is closer, but I manage to push him out 
                of the way with my hellbender and I switch vehicles to the leviathan. Many team 
                mates hop in as well as I'm driving towards the exits. Oh wait...Is this the 
                right exit? I stop and check my map. Yes...we appear to be heading toward their 
                tank node. I deploy the tank and aim for their node. Hah, I hope they have health 
                insurance when I...<br>
                WTF? Node Isolated? Hey...what happened to my first node? OMG, no one defended 
                there! While honking the horn in frustration I type out '<i>my team sucks</i>'. 
                Why do I always have to do everything around here? Ok team let them have their 
                tank node. I'm turning this thing back! Hey, what's that up there? A bomber! 
                Quick, over the mountain with this thing!</p>
            <p>Does this story ring a bell? It's the story of Mr. Average, playing on Severance. 
                The scary thing is: Mr. Average is not a n00b! He uses tactics and strategies, 
                but has only a small grasp of the term teamwork. And on this map - more than 
                any other I know - you'll have to rely on each others skills to win a match 
                on this map.</p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                It's easy to describe Severance: it's basically a gigantic Roman ten (an X with 
                lines above and below it), with the bases located on the side. The width is 
                pretty big and always constant. On the sides rise big mountainwalls to block 
                your view. Finally, it slopes a bit on the inside of the 'X', but the center 
                is pretty flat. All nodes and the cores are a bit protected by ruins.</p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                Speed and agility are important in this game. Give team members a ride, especially 
                when you're driving the <a href="ons_combat.html#Manta">manta</a>, because 
                this is the fastest vehicle. Meanwhile, the raptor can quickly make it over 
                the wall toward the tank node (2 for red, 3 for blue), 'steals' the nearby redeemer, 
                and claims the node as soon as the first one is built by the manta drivers (who 
                will then proceed under the bridge to the other tank node).</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this course of action is too complex for most players, so here's 
                how you should proceed on this map: try to see the opening moves as a race to 
                get the first 2 nodes up. Your course of action depends on your position against 
                the rest of your team, when you arrive at the first node...<br>
                <u>First position:</u> you've got a node to link up. There are only 2 reasons 
                to stop early. One reason is when the node is green <i>and</i> no one of your 
                team is heading toward an adjacent node. The other reason is when someone (tries 
                to) link up with you. Only one person is needed to link this node up, since 
                the other nodes are pretty far away; the first node is still locked anyway.<br>
                <u>Second position:</u> if the 'leader' is linking up the node, you'll have 
                to proceed toward the next node. If you're driving the raptor, you should turn 
                back and head toward their tank node (2 for red, 3 for blue). If you're in a 
                manta, head for your own tank node (3 for red, 2 for blue).<br>
                In case the leader is gone, he's already heading toward the next node. Just 
                finish the job, and proceed <i>with the same vehicle</i> (so stop your vehicle 
                instead of throwing it away somewhere far in the distance). Your fast vehicles 
                are too valuable to lay around abandoned, so don't even think about taking another 
                one. <br>
                <u>Third position:</u> You're probably in the scorpion. If the first two players 
                know what they're doing, the first node shouldn't be vulnerable for some time 
                now. You can head for the center and orientate yourself once you get there (pick 
                up that target painter underway). Keep an eye on the other team's territory, 
                and link up the center node as long as things keep quiet.<br>
                Let's back up a bit: you're on the first node and the enemies are building either 
                tank node. In this scenario, the first node needs some protection against redeemers 
                and enemies..<br>
                <u>Later positions:</u> I'm not sure. A hellbender is a good defending vehicle, 
                but I don't know what the other vehicles should do. It depends on how the situation 
                looks by now :-\<br>
                <u>Last place:</u> it can happen that you spawn too late, and that everyone 
                has left in a vehicle. Then there is no use in running to the first node; get 
                to the power core and transport yourself to the first node, as soon as it is 
                finished.<br>
                <br>
                Lots of tactics, and it's all just for the opening moves of the match! Good. 
                Anyone who has taken more than a glimpse at the map should have seen that the 
                center node is completely unnecessary when you take the goal of onslaught in 
                mind. This probably goes in against everything you've experienced in this map, 
                so I'll make it clear: <i>focus on the corner nodes instead of the center node!!!</i><br>
                Many players try to put up the center node to bring the levi into play. This 
                is a waste of time, because even if you manage to set up the node, it will take 
                quite some time before you arrive at a node with it. And this entire time there 
                are two nodes vulnerable. By taking out either corner node, you lock the center 
                which will make things a lot easier over there. The 2 redeemers in the map even 
                urge you to follow this strategy, because the best way to protect your nodes 
                is by locking them.<br>
                Taking out the corner nodes (the first one is preferred, of course) is a stealth 
                job; the faster you can take it down, the more you help your team. On the other 
                hand is this also the reason why you should have defence: even a single infantry 
                can delay enemies long enough to allow the attackers to lock the node.<br>
                Let's assume that you knocked down one of their nodes and you have build the 
                center node. Get in the leviathan and take your time to orientate yourself. 
                Your goal is their first node, no matter what. It's up to the rest of the team 
                to take out the (isolated) tank node and to delay the enemy team while you come 
                closer to their first node. This is another reason only to go for the center 
                once a cornernode is down: it reduces the chance you arrive at a node when it 
                becomes locked.<br>
                With the levi at their first node (or a combination of other vehicles), it shouldn't 
                be too hard to take over all other nodes, and to claim this first node. Once 
                you pull this off, it's best to use the levi as defender of the node, while 
                the airborne vehicles infiltrate their base to damage the core. Keep in mind 
                that the walls can be climbed, so attackers have an even easier access to the 
                core.<br>
                Victory is near, but you haven't won yet. Make sure you have someone picking 
                up the redeemers, even if he won't have a chance to use them. The first node 
                is still a long distance from the adjacent nodes, which makes sure that the 
                losing team can pull up a decent defence, <i>if</i> they can re-claim the node.</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>the damage amp in the bases belong to the raptor pilot: he is the only one 
                    who can reach enemy territory within 30 seconds: just fly off to the nearby 
                    tank node. The only exception is the the manta, if the first node is taken</li>
                <li>raptors are the ideal choice to grab the forgotten superweapons</li>
                <li>if your opponents have a leviathan, destroy it <i>before</i> you destroy 
                    their center node. Capturing the node while they still have their tank gives 
                    you nothing</li>
                <li>a redeemer can't destroy a leviathan; save it for the nodes</li>
                <li>use the target painter on the roads between nodes, if you expect an enemy 
                    convoy (or just a leviathan) coming that way. Deployed levi's or power cores 
                    are also a good target </li>
                <li>nodes can change hands very quickly on this map. Keep an eye out for nodes 
                    that are under attack; it indicates a bad time to start an attack at an adjacent 
                    node</li>
                <li>try to grab their damage amp if you're attacking their power core</li>
                <li>the big hills can be climbed, but they can't be camped: if you aren't gone

            <h2><a name="Torlan"></a>Torlan</h2>
            <p><img src="pics/torlan.jpg" width="763" height="656"></p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                Torlan is the most open map of the bunch. All nodes but the middle one - which 
                is located in a narrow canyon - have straight vision to almost everywhere. All 
                those open nodes are armed with a turret, but AVRiL's are kinda rare. This makes 
                vehicles an important factor in this map, so you better learn to manage yourself 
                on foot with the other weapons...</p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                Immediately start by heading out to the first node, behind the steep hill. The 
                best way is by manta, but a fully loaded hellbender is a good choice as well. 
                The raptor has a special goal in this map: it is the only vehicle that can grab 
                the redeemer on top of the level. Since nodes are hard to destroy on this map, 
                the purpose of the redeemers is even more important than on other maps.<br>
                After the first node is set up, it's best that the manta proceeds toward the 
                tank node while the hellbender makes its way to the canyon.<br>
                The center node will be the focus of the action; it's always a good idea to 
                use the tank to gain control of the canyon.<br>
                Airborne vehicles are known to make stealth attacks on the tank nodes, or at 
                least the tank if it's still around. Though this approach takes more time than 
                the blitzkrieg from the center to their node, it's also a part every team should 
                be aware of. If the tank node gets captured, the enemy team will have a tank 
                that has a more than decent position to attack the first node.<br>
                Most games end the moment the first node is destroyed. That node has a lower 
                location than the adjacent ones, which allows the enemies to delay the reconstruction 
                of that node easily. The enemies on the other hand, don't have much problems 
                claiming the isolated nodes and pushing back the players to the power core.<br>
                Comebacks are rare once the first node is captured: the tank (from the nearby 
                tank node) provides defence from far away and infantry can cover the place with 
                spider mines. The power core base is a real fortress, complete with high walls 
                and turrets. Unfortunately, the core is pretty much in the open, which makes 
                it an easy target for airborne vehicles.<br>
                But even with the first node captured, the fight isn't over: a fully manned 
                hellbender can quickly cut through the node's defenses and destroy it fast. 
                They can also bring in backup that snipes or AVRiL's from their base's tower. 
                Still, its no match for a defending tank.<br>
                And about that tanks: remember you have two of them! Your own tank node isn't 
                exactly near their base, but its firepower really helps out.<br>
                As a wild card, there's a redeemer on top of the tower, together with a super 
                shield pack and a nice overview of the level. The disadvantage is that this 
                place is only reachable by raptor. From up there, you can snipe everyone and 
                lock in on every vehicle. And of course tear down some enemy nodes with the 
                redeemer...<br>
                <b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>when the enemy team has the central node, you can push the vehicles that 
                    spawn on top of the hill from the platform. On many occasions, the enemies 
                    won't even suspect their vehicles are still close by</li>
                <li>the hellbender that spawns in the center is a good tool to snipe down on 
                    people and even vehicles (like raptors) from far away</li>
                <li>the center is also a good spot for long distance shots and AVRiL-targetting</li>
                <li>make sure you defend your first node if it isn't locked: the turret is a 
                    good weapon to stop incoming redeemers and light vehicles</li>
                <li>manta's can use the hill between the first node and the base to jump all 
                    the way into the power core base</li>
                <li>with a bit of practice, manta's can make it to the top of the towers in 
                    the bases: they just need a running start and the right place to lift off. 
                    To get on blue's tower, you must use the hill nearby the center tower. For 
                    red's tower, you must use the mountains on the side of the level to boost 
                    yourself up there</li>
                <li>if you respawn in the canyon, there are two ways to reach the top: either 
                    use the jump pad nearby, or use the node to transport yourself to the same 
                    node again</li>
                <li>if you fall down from the top of the center tower, try to land on the jump 
                    pad: if you manage to land on it, you won't get falling damage</li>
                <li>don't use the damage amp to link up the center node: it won't speed things 
                    up</li>
                <li>if you have the enemies locked at their base: don't forget you have 2 tanks 
                    now. You can use it to effectively blast the base from the side entrance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In case you haven't downloaded the <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/files/130000/139015.shtml">OnslaughtBonusMapPack</a>, 
                I suggest you do so now. This 'pack' contains 2 new, semi-official maps, made 
                by professional mappers. Initially, this pack was released as windows-only (don't 
                know why?), but they are available for all OS's as well (I hope I'm linking 
                to the universal one).</p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                If you ask me, Aridoom is is set on Tattooine. The rocky desert can be anywhere 
                and the old garages and freeway can be accidental as well, but this map even 
                <i>plays</i> like a variant of a podrace. There are no multiple node routes 
                and no true airborne vehicles around, so it's all a matter of which team can 
                transport the most firepower in the shortest amount of time.</p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                This map is setup in a way that there are always two routes between each node 
                of about the same length. Between the base and the first node, you have the 
                choice of going over open terrain, or through a dry riverbed. These routes join 
                at a hill, after which you can see the first node, located in a garage. Unlike 
                what you would expect, the node is located on the side of the garage, though 
                all the vehicles spawn inside.<br>
                To get to the central node, you'll have to find an entrance to the freeway. 
                There is one on the far left from the garage, another one on the far right of 
                the map, and finally one close by the center. The last one is a bit shorter 
                when coming from the garage, but involves more z-axis. The center is the first 
                place of combat, so make sure you keep an eye out for enemies. This center node 
                is at about the same distance to all other nodes and bases, so attack the center 
                from both sides.<br>
                Keeping the center isn't easy, because the other team can attack it from both 
                sides as well. Luckily, there are the turrets that can keep them away and there 
                is also another tank present.<br>
                It's easy to miss, but this center contains a redeemer: it's located directly 
                above the node, over a long balk. To reach it, you must jump on top of some 
                boxes; you can use a manta to get closer, but don't try to park on the balk 
                itself. This redeemer is the main reason to keep defense at the first node if 
                it's vulnerable, but it also leads to quick changes in the match because enemies 
                can also sneak in to grab it and quickly destroy the center node.<br>
                Even to attack their first node is the base in a good position: it's almost 
                a straight line, whereas you must make a quite long detour if you're coming 
                from the center node. The first node can be defended very good, so try to co-ordinate 
                your attack (this includes your redeemer missile: only launch it when there 
                are team mates underway).<br>
                Even the final step isn't easy, because the base is even a better fortress than 
                the garage. Sneak in from both sides, but don't neglect to defend the adjacent 
                node...</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>timing is a very important factor here. Co-ordinated attacks are much more 
                    powerfull than lone wolf attacks</li>
                <li>for the same reason: don't abandon your team mates if you're in a faster 
                    vehicle than they are, except at the beginning of a match</li>
                <li>the damage amp is meant for the manta: other vehicles are too slow to gain 
                    an advantage with the damage bonus</li>
            </ul>

            <p><img src="pics/ascendancy.jpg" width="808" height="700"></p>
            <p> The second map of the <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/files/130000/139015.shtml">OnslaughtBonusMapPack</a>, 
                the first one being <a href="ons_maps.html#Aridoom">Aridoom</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                From above, this dusky map is shaped like a crescent. Don't let this fool you: 
                the level is huge. Both bases are open and stretched out, with a big front gate 
                and a backdoor to the sidenode. The center part of the map is a big mountain, 
                which will be fought over both from the outside and the inside.</p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                The beginning of the match is always the same: everyone gets through the front 
                gate in the direction of the first node. Only one manta should head in the direction 
                of the sidenode (also through the front gate: going through the back of the 
                base goes too slow), touch it and turn back toward the first node. Oh, and he 
                should pick up the 'deemer which spawns about at this time.<br>
                While the fastest vehicles arrive at the first node, the rest of the team should 
                split up: a part should stay outside and head for the outside node; since this 
                outside node spawns a leviathan, it is the most important one to claim. Prevent 
                the enemy team to build the node at all cost, because it is strong enough to 
                make it toward the first node and to destroy it, even if your entire team is 
                fighting against it.<br>
                Meanwhile, the other part of the team should go through the tunnel to the inside 
                of the mountain. There are only 3 entrances to the node inside, so it can be 
                controlled a lot better than the chaotic outside node. The node also spawns 
                2 strategically important vehicles: the raptor, which has its own exit through 
                the roof, can reach every part of the map easily. The other vehicle is the tank: 
                this spawns underneath the central entrance; it can exit through the side entrance 
                fast and attack the first node from the least defended side.<br>
                In many occasions, destroying the first node determines the winning team (which 
                is also a reason why many servers use a different link setup). Once it is conquered, 
                the attacking team has easy access to a redeemer, target painter (on top of 
                the mountain) and a leviathan, and an even chance to grab the redeemer close 
                by the defending team's base. These defenders still have a lot of firepower 
                in their base, and it won't be easy to infiltrate all the way to the power core 
                (not even with airborne vehicles). If things really take too long, shift your 
                focus to their sidenode; they can't spare the effort to seriously defend it, 
                so capturing is a possibility. Once this is completed, you can cross the rough 
                terrain to enter their base right next to the power core.</p>
            <p><br>
                <b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>there are plenty of vehicles lying around, but infantry is far from useless: 
                    the central mountain has plenty of balconies from where they can AVRiL down 
                    on enemies and even attack nodes. The many jump pads even increase their possibilities, 
                    just like the target painter that lies in the center. Note that this target 
                    painter can not directly target the outside node</li>
                <li>take care of the redeemers: just as in Severance, they make sure that nodes 
                    can change hands fast</li>
                <li>the description advises 16-22 players, but it plays just as fine with only 
                    12</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="Icarus"></a>Icarus</h2>
            <p><img src="pics/icarus.jpg" width="687" height="692"></p>
            <p>Icarus was the first map to receive the 'ownage' award. This means that you 
                can grab this map from ingame: from the main menu, go to '<font color="#0000FF">Community-Ownage 
                    maps</font>'. The big question is: does this first map live up to its expectations? 
                To be honest: it's somewhat of a mixed bag. Nobody can deny the professionalism 
                that is used to construct and balance out this level, but since the extreme 
                amount of z-axis makes this a classic love-it-or-hate-it kinda map...</p>
            <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
                The entire level takes place on the top floors of skyscrapers. This makes navigating 
                non-airborne vehicles rather hard, because on many occasions you have to change 
                floors to get to your destination. A good rule of thumb is that if you're on 
                a fork, you best take the highest road. If you turn out to be higher than your 
                destination, you can simply drop down (assuming there is a floor below).<br>
                There are many ramps scattered through this level: hellbenders and scorpions 
                can use them to hop to the other side, but <i>only</i> if they can get there 
                unhindered <i>and</i> if they have a decent running start. A <a href="movement.html#Basic">running 
                    dodgejump</a> gets you on the other side as well. Tanks simply <i>can not</i> 
                make it to the other side.<br>
                The last feature is also the one most complained about: there is a building 
                alongside the first node that contains a restricted leviathan.</p>
            <p><b>Match setup:</b><br>
                The main base consists of 3 levels. Use the jump pads to reach the top and middle 
                ones, because they contain the best vehicles (a raptor and manta).<br>
                To get to the first node, you'll have to cross a long platform; infantry can 
                use jump pads to speed up their travelling. Once the first node is up, things 
                get more complicated.<br>
                The building that lies in front of you blocks the way to the central square. 
                This square is surrounded by four buildings in total, each of which have a balcony. 
                When you go left at your node, you'll end up at the balcony. The lower right 
                route leads to the square, just as the route on the inside of the building does.<br>
                As you can see on the map, the two buildings on the side make out the nodes. 
                Node 1 lies in an urban valley, one floor below the square. Enemies can drop 
                down from above, but the vehicles spawn in a reasonable position to attack the 
                enemy first node.<br>
                Node 2 is positioned one floor above the balcony: it can be seen (and thus destroyed) 
                from far away, but it's not easy to approach it if you're not in an airborne 
                vehicle.<br>
                But there is more going on in the node buildings: underneath the square are 
                small balconies that offer a nice view from the scenery below. Far down lies 
                a balk with a target painter on it, just as well as a teleporter that gets you 
                back to the square again. I advise against picking it up, though. The time you'll 
                spend taking it can be used a lot better...</p>
            <p>Let's go back to the first node: non-airborne vehicles should always take the 
                left route; they can use the ramps to hop to the nearby node buildings, or they 
                can drop down to the square if they have to. The raptor pilot should touch the 
                sidenode (not linking it up) and immediately head for node 2. Meanwhile, manta's 
                can provide backup or scouting for either group.<br>
                Once you gain control of a center node, all the airborne vehicles should make 
                their way to the other team's first node. Land vehicles aren't a good choice 
                attacking it, because it takes too much time to navigate them into the right 
                position. Don't attack with them until the first node is effectively destroyed 
                and the enemy team has to retreat to rebuild their node. Airborne vehicles should 
                either delay this rebuilding, or conquer the other central node, depending on 
                what's the easiest job.</p>
            <p>The next part is the hardest: this is the part where the enemies will man their 
                leviathan. Many teams try to defend the node, attack their power core and pick 
                on the leviathan...all at the same time. This rarely - if ever - works. I suggest 
                you stop the attack and focus on their levi, while you deny them their first 
                node. Repeatedly using the 3 available raptors should bear results quickly. 
                The hard part is over when the levi is down: now focus all your efforts on claiming 
                their first node and <i>defend it with everyone but one</i>. This last fellow 
                captures the sidenode and - in turn - mans the leviathan. If he deploys it, 
                he can take take shots at the enemy base; 3 or 4 blasts should destroy the core 
                from splash damage.</p>
            <p><b>Strategies/tactics:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>airborne vehicles are by far the best choice for attacks</li>
                <li>the team that has node 2 on their left side can hit this node with their 
                    tank from nearby their first node</li>
                <li>ground troops can also harass the levi, by shooting both regular and AVRiL 
                    rockets at it, but they should always be prepared to take cover</li>
                <li>stop harassing the leviathan if the rest of your team can't prevent the 
                    enemy team from reclaiming their node <i>and</i> their leviathan node is already 
                    destroyed. In this scenario, they can simply rebuild the sidenode and get 
                    a fresh levi<br>
                </li>
            </ul>
