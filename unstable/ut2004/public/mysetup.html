        <i>&quot;There is no such thing as a &quot;self-made&quot; man. We are made up 
            of thousands of others. Everyone who has ever done a kind deed for us, ;or spoken 
            one word of encouragement to us, has entered into the make-up of our character 
            and of our thoughts, as well as our success.&quot; - Adams, George Matthew</i> 
        <h2>Intro: the importance of comfortableness</h2>
        <p>One of the most frequently asked questions on gaming forums is &quot;what is 
            a good setup for a game?&quot; There are many different answers out there, depending 
            on computer aspects, preferences and personal experiences. However, everyone 
            agrees that a setup should be <i>comfortable</i>. Nothing can disrupt a good 
            gaming experience like a huge lag, sudden framerate drops or even game crashes. 
            But comfort is more than that...when looking at it from a distance, all games 
            have an amount of routine within them. Some actions are used often, others rarely 
            and yet others you'll never use. learn to recognize this routine and adapt your 
            key setup to this.</p>
        <p>Note that a good setup is personal. What I'm about to tell in this article 
            is how I play UT2004, mostly the key setup. I'll explain my motivations and 
            my intentions. However, I'm <i>not</i> writing this down so you can simply copy-paste 
            everything to your own UT2004 folder. That's just stupid, because I'm exactly 
            like everyone else: unique. My setup isn't yours; I'm just using it as my best 
            example in the hope it might inspire you (besides...if you don't have an N52, 
            you <i>can't</i> even mimic this). I've tweaked this setup for over a year now, 
            so it <i>might</i> have some more advanced, or more efficient keys. The technical 
            explanation of the given commands can be found on <a href="commands.html">this 
                page</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Hardware"></a>Hardware &amp; software</h2>
        <p>First things first: the minimum requirements of UT2004 are too low. I'm not 
            going to repeat them here, because you ABSOLUTELY do not want to play at such 
            settings (128 MB RAM is <i>by far</i> insufficient). you can find my computer 
            specifications below, and I had to tweak some settings to get smooth settings 
            in all gametypes. And that's what it's all about: framerates. Though critics 
            (like myself) claim that anything above 20 frames per second can be seen as 
            &quot;smooth&quot;, but I must admit that higher framerates just gives a better 
            overall feel to the game. Like Johnathan &quot;Fatal1ty&quot; Wendel once stated: 
            &quot;<i>A couple more frames per second and everything gets really nice. It&#146;s 
                all about getting more frames, the computer filling stuff more quickly and allowing 
                you to move around the maps more fluidly&#148;</i></p>
        <p>So...of course you could go out and get the latest computer to improve things, 
            but try the following steps first (copy-pasted from a BuF thread)</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get the latest patch (<a href="http://www.beyondunreal.com/main/ut2004/ut2004essential.php">version 
                    3355</a> at the moment)</li>
            <li>Go to Settings, and then to the game tab. There, uncheck 'speech recognition 
                and 'preload all player skins'. In the 'Audio' tab, uncheck the settings of 
                'Text to speech'. These are functions that are 'convenient', yet terrible 
                memory hogs</li>
            <ul>
                <li>speech recognition allows you to order bots around by voice, provided 
                    that you have the (free) software and the microphone installed</li>
                <li>preload all player skins loads every skin into memory while loading a 
                    map. The option prevents your computer to freeze for a split second when 
                    a new player joins (the skin has to be loaded in the memory). Disabling 
                    this option considerably shortens level load times.</li>
                <li>Text to speech reads all written chat messages aloud. Though this might 
                    help online co-ordination, it might be a nuisance when playing with chat-happy 
                    players. It also takes up a big deal of memory.</li>
            </ul>
            <li> Go the Settings, in the Display tab. There, uncheck some settings and lower 
                your details. The parts of the visuals you sacrifice will be rewarded in better 
                framerates and a clearer visibility (less &quot;cluttering&quot; by fancy 
                effects)</li>
            <li>if you're still having problems, it's best to visit <a href="http://www.tweakguides.com/UT2004_1.html">Tweakguides</a>. 
                In 13 steps, it'll show you every UT2004 tweak out there, from driver and 
                OS updates to getting rid of the NVidialogo intro movie.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you're still having problems at this point, it might be time to upgrade 
            your rig. I can't help with this, since I don't have the funds to try out all 
            sorts of hardware equipment. All I can say is that my computer - after a few 
            tweaks - produces a smooth framerate (onslaught and assault maps are usually 
            somewhat in the 20-30's, but I'm fine with it...).</p>

        <h2><a name="Keyboard"></a>Keyboard setup</h2>
        <p>As far as I can judge, most standard keyboards (=PS-2 ones) suffice for FPS 
            play. The only difference that matters is in the key setup. On practically any 
            forums you'll find threads with polls on movement setups, usually dividing the 
            audience into the arrow-people (who use the arrows for movement), the WASD people, 
            the RDFG/TFGH/... people and the ones with something completely unique.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrows are the most intuitive ones. It's usually standard in games and very 
                quick to adapt to. <i>The</i> main disadvantage is the fact that other keys 
                are located further away, causing an important delay when using the other 
                keys. For this reason, it's not adviced to stick to this setup. For completeness 
                sake, I must admit I know one player who has become very good yet still sticks 
                to arrow keys.</li>
            <li>WASD is pretty popular and has adjacent keys in quick reach. Though it's 
                like a second standard to many games, I don't really understand why this is 
                better, because...</li>
            <li>RDFG (or a variant) has both keys on the left as on the right side of the 
                movement keys (I was one of these guys)</li>
            <li>unique setups are the hardest to adjust to. However, these usually have 
                the advantage of <i>quick</i> switching between back and forth (it's set up 
                to use different fingers)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Switching a setup is tough. It's a guarantee that your performance in the game 
            will go down drastically, and it's very likely to have some embarrasing results 
            (switching to wrong weapons, dodging into a ravine,...). Make sure to inforce 
            the following rules:</p>
        <table width="87%" border="1">
            <tr>
                <td height="76"><b>usefullness rule:</b> think about your new setup. It must 
                    be intuitive and helpfull, either allowing for more keys within quick reach, 
                    or at least put important keys closer by your hand<br>
                    <b>adaptation rule: </b>don't change too much at once. Altering many things 
                    will make it exponentionally harder to get used to the changes.<br>
                    <b>1 week rule:</b> if you still have problems after a week thoroughly playing 
                    with the new setup, consider going back to the last one.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>With that said, here's <a href="pics/keyboard.JPG">my keyboard setup</a>.</p>
        <p>The first thing that's important about it is that it's an AZERTY keyboard (as 
            opposed to the QWERTY keyboards in most other countries). The main difference 
            is that 'Q' and 'A' are switched, 'W' and 'Z' and ';'and 'M'.<br>
            Then there's the windows key, which is disabled. Not just in the game, but <i>everywhere</i>. 
            You can reach this effect with a screwdriver and a hammer, or you can just use 
            <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/krumsick/">keytweak</a>, a freeware program 
            that allows to remap your keyboard.</p>
        <p>Other things are either self-explanatory, or described in my <a href="commands.html">advanced 
                commands</a> guide.</p>
        <h2><a name="N52"></a>N52 setup</h2>
        <p>There's a lot of stuff written on the Nostromo N52 (<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/game/200403061/">this</a>, 
            for example), and as you can expect from commercial sites, they don't point 
            out the bad sides of it. The thing is sturdy and fits in my hand pretty good 
            (sorry...can only speak for myself here; I've got big hands). The keys were 
            somewhat hard to press at first, but after a week, things were fine.</p>
        <p>However...what these sites DON'T tell you is that not all keys are accessible 
            as they seem. Pretty soon, I discovered that the bottom row of the speedpad 
            - as well as the extra mousewheel - was out of reach for <i>quick</i> keypressing 
            (the fact that the keys aren't diagonally positioned might have something to 
            do with it). The movement cross thingy, on the other hand, couldn't have been 
            better: after 2-3 weeks of thumb training, I'm finally able to switch weapons 
            without even having to lift my movement fingers (except when I need an explosive 
            weapon, but I mostly use the switchtobestweapon key on the mouse for that). 
            The biggest problem with the thing is the thumb button, though. Though it appears 
            to look like a small space bar, <i>it can only be pressed by pressing the right 
                side of the button</i> ('right' as in 'opposite side of left'). This is pretty 
            frustrating; I even thought my device was broken, until some online friends 
            pointed out this is normal. It took me about a month to fully get used to it, 
            but now that I am, I wouldn't trade back my keyboard for the world (so to speak).</p>
        <p>The Nostro comes with more-than-decent software to get everything running. 
            It even allows for macros and rebinds, but that's just lame. I'm just using 
            it to rebind everything to keys from the keyboard. Anyway...<a href="pics/N52.JPG">this 
                is my setup</a></p>
        <h2><a name="Mouse"></a>Mouse</h2>
        <p>Let's face it...keyboards and speedpads are just dumb keypressing devices. 
            Movement in the UT-series is an art, but having a 1'000$ keyboard won't give 
            you an edge over someone with a standard PS-2 keyboard. This analogy doesn't 
            work where computer mouses are involved. After playing with a regular standard 
            mouse for years, I suddenly became a much better player when I bought a new 
            mouse and tweaked some settings I didn't even knew existed.</p>
        <p>One of the main things about mouse sensitivity is the fact that there are so 
            many external factors (windows setting, kind of mouse, ingame setting) that 
            influence the effective settings. Just as with the keyboard settings, forums 
            also have a few threads in which players compare ingame mouse settings. And 
            if the forum regulars know their game, they'll always answer in distances it 
            takes to turn 360&deg;. According to <a href="http://www.ocrana.de/utbible/controls.htm">Flocutus' 
                UT bible</a>, it's best to use a sensitivity between 8cm / 360&deg; and 12cm 
            / 360&deg; (3.15inch / 360&deg; and 4.72inch / 360&deg;). The higher your sensitivity, 
            the better your reflex weapons and delayed weapons will be. Lower sensitivity 
            is better for trace-hit weapons. UT2004 is a pretty hitscan-oriented game, so 
            unsurprisingly, these players use a pretty low sensitivity...</p>
        <p>Here's an exercise: close your eyes and try to touch your nose softly. Easy, 
            isn't it? You've been doing things like this for your entire life, so input 
            from your senses is barely needed. You should try to translate these 'instincts' 
            to the game as much as possible. Suppose someone ripped off your arm and docters 
            gave you a mechanical replacement one. However, one of this arm's features is 
            that whenever you <i>think</i> you're moving this arm at a constant speed, it 
            actually increases the speed in time. Would you perform the exercise just as 
            easily? I don't think so.<br>
            So start the game, go to <font color="#008000">Settings - Input</font> and set 
            both the <font color="#008000">Mouse Smoothing Strength</font> and the <font color="#008000">Mouse 
                Accel. treshold</font> to 0. This can already mean a big deal for your sensitivity 
            (you might want to alter the <font color="#008000">Mouse Sensitivity (game)</font> 
            to compensate for things), but it's not enough. You see, the ingame settings 
            come on top of Windows' mouse settings, so you should check your mouse settings 
            (In windows: <font color="#008000">Start menu</font> -&gt; <font color="#008000">Settings</font> 
            -&gt; <font color="#008000">Control Panel</font> -&gt; <font color="#008000">Mouse</font>) 
            to make sure all traces of acceleration are gone (NOTE: if you're having a MX510, 
            the option &quot;disable acceleration in games&quot; doesn't work with UT2004, 
            so turn it off completely). For completeness sake, I must say I've heard that 
            there's a mouse fix that &quot;<i>allows Windows XP users to counter-act the 
                effects if locked mouse acceleration in Windows XP.</i>&quot; It's a simple 
            registry tweak, but I can't say I have seen any improvement. Anyhow...you can 
            find mirrors <a href="http://www.gotfrag.com/portal/files/82/###">here</a> and 
            <a href="ftp://ftp.thecpl.com/mouse_fix.zip">here</a>.</p>
        <p>And there's more outside tweaks you can enforce, like the mouserate polling. 
            By default, windows limits USB data throughput at 125Hz, or every 8 milliseconds 
            (PS-2 mice are set at ?? milliseconds). Use <a href="http://tscherwitschke.de/download/mouserate.zip">this 
                program</a> to check what yours currently is. You can change this setting to 
            250Hz (4 milliseconds), 500Hz (2 ms) or even 1000Hz (1ms, though this is probably 
            overkill). To do this, use <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/USB-Mouserate-switcher.shtml"> 
                USB Mouserate switcher</a> if you're using XP, and <a href="http://www.proarena.com/p/ftpx/f8455/gaming_tools/usbhz.zip.htm">USBHz</a> 
            if you're using Windows 2000.<br>
            To me, this change didn't <i>seemed</i> to change anything (except that my reflex 
            aim <i>seems</i> to have improved), but other users have noted that their mouse 
            moved a little faster. See for yourself, and change your sensitivity when needed...</p>
        <p>The mouse itself is an important factor as well. I used to play with a standard 
            mouse; I've heard a lot of complaints that non-optical mice weren't smooth enough, 
            but I must disagree to that. Yes, I had to clean it from time to time (approx. 
            every two weeks) to retain its smoothness; all that was needed was a screwdriver, 
            a cloth with eau-de-cologne, a toothpick and about 15 minutes. So for me, changing 
            to an optical mouse (a logitech MX510) was mainly to get extra buttons. It also 
            proved that different mice have different sensitivities: I hadn't changed a 
            single setting (besides installing the mouse drivers, of course), but the ingame 
            sensitivity was a lot higher than what I remembered (I played with acceleration, 
            at that time).<br>
            And what's a mouse without a mouse mat? There's a market for this as well (like 
            the icemats), but as long as you've got a flat, smooth surface that is big enough, 
            you'll do fine (at least...I think so). Just don't use a mat that comes with 
            arm-supporting jelly, as that seriously hinders quick movement.</p>
        <p>But anyway...the extra keys for the mouse didn't take long to figure out: <a href="pics/mouse.JPG">here 
                they are</a>. I must note that initially, the two buttons up and down the scroll 
            wheel weren't available ingame. First, I had to go to the windows mouse settings 
            to bind them to keys (page up and page down). The thumb buttons are available 
            in UT2004, but not in UT -&gt; I had to rebind those to keys as well.</p>
        <h2><a name="KeySetup"></a>Key setup</h2>
        <p>(NOTE: the rest of this page is a rehash of the &quot;Discussion issues&quot; 
            page I have written earlier. I think it's better suited here)</p>
        <p>The good key setup is probably the most argued over issue in gaming industry...And 
            the discussion wouldn't last long if there was an easy answer. The only thing 
            that everyone can agree on is that a good setup allows you to act and react 
            quickly to each situation. If you have to glance at the keyboard for basic actions, 
            or if you have to constantly reach all over your keyboard to reach keys, then 
            your setup is wrong. If you don't have this problem, your setup <i>might</i> 
            be good.<br>
            I say might, because it's not sure wether you can adapt to all the given circumstances. 
            With the diversity of gametypes in mind, some actions can be important in gametype 
            A, yet unnecessary in gametype B. Let's take a closer look at the different 
            actions:<br>
            <b>Crucial actions:</b> <font color="#008000">forward, backward, left, right, 
                jump, prim fire, alt fire</font> and <i>&quot;some way to change weapons&quot;</i>. 
            You simply cannot play UT2004 without these actions (or any other FPS for that 
            matter). They should rest underneath your fingers to get the best reaction time 
            - only the movement keys can be as much as one fingertip away.<br>
            <i>&quot;Some way to change weapons&quot;</i> is different for everyone: the 
            professionals among us will tell you that binding almost each weapon to a different 
            key is the best way to outdraw your opponent. This is completely correct, but 
            you'll need more than just &quot;a few weeks&quot; to truly get comfortable 
            with this. Playing with just a <i>switchtobestweapon</i> key and a next weapon 
            - previous weapon combo (traditionally set to the mousewheel) gets you close 
            enough to this. Just avoid the <i>weapon switch on pickup-</i>option: it has 
            the tendency of switching at the most inappropriate times<br>
            <b>Important actions:</b> <font color="#008000">duck, use, translocator, shieldgun</font> 
            and <font color="#008000">throwweapon</font> are important to have, but somewhat 
            related to the gametype you're playing. They shouldn't be straight below your 
            fingertips, but it's not a good idea to bind them far away either.<br>
            <font color="#008000">Crouching</font> has some advantages (see <a href="movement.html#Basic">movement</a>), 
            but you can survive without it unless you're playing onslaught (where you'll 
            make a fool out of yourself if you can't lower your plane).<br>
            <font color="#008000">Use</font> is only needed in onslaught and assault, but 
            rather crucial in those gametypes.<br>
            The <font color="#008000">translocator</font> doesn't deserve its own button 
            for the pretty (useless) camera, but because a quick change to the translocator 
            can save your life on many occasions. Just take a look at the other players 
            in CTF and BR: the translocator simply dominates those gametypes; you better 
            get used to it.<br>
            The <font color="#008000">shieldgun</font> (or the popular switchtoshieldgun-hold 
            altfire-switchtolastweapon combo) is a lifesaver: when falling from great heights 
            or being under heavy fire you won't have the luxury of fumbling through all 
            your weapons for this gun in order to set up a shield; you need it <i>QUICK!</i> 
            Hence this simple bind. Oh, and binding the gun instead of the combo adds the 
            possibility to push enemies around when they least expect it ;-)<br>
            <font color="#008000">Throwweapon</font> is a harder issue. If <i>weapons stay</i> 
            is on, this bind can help you get <i>more</i> ammo for your weapons. Get used 
            to the routine of checking your weapon ammo when you walk by a weapon pickup 
            spot, throwing this weapon if you have less than the ammo of the pickup weapon 
            and then proceed by picking up this weapon. This can take just a few hours to 
            get used to, or up to months if you often forget about your bind. TDM players 
            usually combine this bind with a teamsay of <i>&quot;Hey, dude! Looky here: 
                I dropped a %W for ya :-)&quot;</i>, because TDM is played with <i>weapons stay</i> 
            off by default. Throwing weapons is pretty useless in gametypes with weapon 
            lockers.<br>
            <b>Lesser actions:</b> these are about all other actions; actions that can be 
            helpfull but nothing that can save yourself in a heated battle. Therefore, they 
            shouldn't be bound close to your hand. If you can't remember which button you 
            assigned for the action, then it's better not to assign it at all<br>
            Typical lesser actions include team orders, scoretoggle (to check the teams 
            and who has the best personal score or Points Per Hour), the different menu's, 
            behindview and suicide.</p>
        <h2><a name="WeaponView"></a>Weapon view and crosshairs</h2>
        <p>As far as I know, the Unreal-series are the only ones where you can change 
            your weapon hand (left, right, center or hidden).They all shoot to the center 
            of the screen, yet still this setting has an influence on your aim.<br>
            Avoid left and right weapon hand: these settings throws projectiles from the 
            side rather than from the center. While this only makes a real difference at 
            very close range, the psychological offset carries on to long range.<br>
            Center or hidden weapon view shoot straight on target. Hidden weapons gives 
            a clearer view of your HUD, and as far as I know, it doesn't cause a framerate 
            drop. Personally, it appears that weapon switching happens even faster with 
            hidden weapons because you don't have to wait for the '<i>weapon switch</i>'-animation 
            to end. The disadvantage of hidden weapon view is that it makes it harder to 
            tell which weapon you're currently holding...</p>
        <p><a name="Crosshairs"></a>That's where the crosshairs come in. By default, all 
            weapons of UT2004 have a different crosshair. This might be hard to adjust to 
            (at least, some game reviewers didn't like this fact) but it's a good feature, 
            especially when using hidden weapons (<a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=160237">30 
                different people can't be wrong</a>).<br>
            A good crosshair is small yet always visible, and if you have a different one 
            for each weapon, it has to be recognizeable from the others at all time. IMHO, 
            the default ones do a pretty good job at this. They all 'fit' their weapons, 
            they are in a basic color (which is rarely used in maps) and none look alike.<br>
            There is only one disadvantage at these crosshairs: they only have one color. 
            If you want two colors (black and a custom one), you'll have to download some 
            custom ones like the <a href="http://mods.beyondunreal.com/mod.php?id=180">K-aus</a> 
            crosshair pack (currently at version 7.00). It is also possible to change the 
            crosshairs from the vehicles: check <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=141600">this</a> 
            thread for more info. Custom crosshairs can be used under all circumstances.</p>
        <h2><a name="Sound"></a>Sound and music</h2>
        <p>UT2004 comes with great music; it provides a nice touch to the incredible visuals 
            and effects and a music player to add your own mp3 collection to the playerlist. 
            Unfortunately, this very music tends to distract your hearing senses from the 
            sounds that <i>do</i> matter: sounds like hovering mantas, incoming rockets 
            and even footsteps. The more useless sounds you remove, the more likely you'll 
            hear the important ones.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turning the music off is the first step (and the one that's the hardest 
                to adjust to). Don't worry: after a while, you won't even notice it's missing.</li>
            <li>The second step is removing the environmental sounds, also known as ambient 
                sounds. This can't be done from within game, so you'll have to edit <font color="#000080">\System\UT2004.ini</font>. 
                Search the file for <font color="#000080">AmbientVolume</font> and turn it 
                to <font color="#000080">0</font>. It's important to know that some important 
                sound settings (like the alarm sounds from the objectives in assault/ double 
                domination and <i>some</i> of elevators) are also muted when you turn off 
                ambient sounds.<br>
                Update: Slainchild has made fixed versions of popular duel maps, which include 
                proper ambient settings. You can find these <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=167117">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Finally, there's the footsteps issue: you don't expect to hear enemies approach 
                when your own footsteps mingle in with theirs now, do you? For this reason, 
                open up <font color="#000080">\System\user.ini</font> and set <font color="#000080">bPlayOwnFootsteps</font> 
                to <font color="#000080">False</font>. Note that -for some reason- weapon 
                bobbing has to be turned off as well or you still hear your own walking sounds. 
                Not that this is a problem, because weapon bobbing distracts your aim just 
                like left and right weapon hand does...Weapon bobbing doesn't even have an 
                impact on your aim (in contrast to Landing Viewshake, which is best left on).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Visibility"></a>Player visibility</h2>
        <p>There has been - and to a certain extend: still is - a big discussion about 
            the skins and models in UT2004. By default, they are too dark, too small and 
            too diverse. The problem with the diversity part is that some models are better 
            visible than others. This simple fact divides UT2004 players into 3 subcategories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the first group chooses their skin purely because it is harder to see than 
                others, thus giving them a (marginally) better chance of staying unnoticed. 
                Generally, these player use Matrix or Abaddon as their skin</li>
            <li>the character enforcers: it is possible to change all characters ingame 
                to the character you have (see <a href="mysetup.html#ForcingSkins">below</a>). 
                Whilst forcing characters makes it harder to distinguish different players 
                (everyone looks like you), it does facilitate aiming for headshots and it 
                reduces computer CPU a bit.</li>
            <li>the people who don't care about the situation and choose a model or skin 
                that looks cool or has some good animations.<br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Even without forcing skins, there are some ways to edit the visibility of the 
            characters. These changes are completely legal, and therefore are best used.<br>
            In <font color="#000080">\System\user.ini</font>, change the following:<br>
            <font color="#000080">[Engine.Pawn] bNoCoronas=False</font> (this makes players 
            glow with a small halo from a distance)</p>
        <p>In <font color="#000080">\System\UT2004.ini</font>, following visibility improvements 
            can be made (create the paragraph and the line if it doesn't exist)<br>
            <font color="#000080">[UnrealGame.DeathMatch]</font> <font color="#000080">bColoredDMSkins=True<br>
                [UnrealGame.DeathMatch]</font> <font color="#000080">bAllowPlayerLights=True<br>
                [UnrealGame.DMMutator] bBrightSkins=True </font></p>
        <h4><a name="ForcingSkins"></a>Forcing skins</h4>
        <p>First of all: only Gorge, Malcolm, Jakob, Rylisa*, Tamika*, Rapier* and Ophelia* 
            can be forced. Trying to force any other character won't work and still shows 
            all the different characters as though you're not forcing at all.<br>
            Second: if you force offline, everyone will look like you. If you do it online, 
            you will see 2 characters: a male or a female.<br>
            <br>
            You force skins by making the following changes in <font color="#000080">\System\user.ini</font>:<br>
            <font color="#000080">[defaultplayer] Character= <i>&lt;your desired male/female 
                    character&gt;</i></font> (you can only force characters if you are playing with 
            this character as well)<br>
            <font color="#000080">[XGame.xPawn] PlacedCharacterName=<i>&lt;your desired 
                    male character&gt;</i><br>
                [XGame.xPawn] PlacedFemaleCharacterName=<i>&lt;your desired female character&gt;</i><br>
                [UnrealGame.UnrealPawn] PlacedCharacterName=<i>&lt;your desired male/female 
                    character&gt;</i></font></p>
        <p>In addition, you have to make the following changes in <font color="#000080">\System\UT2004.ini</font> 
            (create the paragraph and the line if it doesn't exist)<br>
            <font color="#000080">[UnrealGame.DeathMatch] bForceDefaultCharacter=True</font></p>
        <p>* when you force these characters offline, you will see the other characters 
            as Jakob instead of the one you are using.</p>
        <h2><a name="ConsoleDeathMessages"></a>Ingame messages</h2>
        <p>There are quite some &quot;say&quot; commands that are pretty convenient. Adding 
            binds to this will allow you to brief your teammates about which weapon you 
            dropped, which health/armor/adrenaline status you have or a simple location 
            index of the important stuff (eg. <font color="#008000">teamsay &lt;&lt;&lt;left&lt;&lt;&lt;</font>). 
            On crowded servers, it can happen that these binds get lost between the many 
            death messages that appear in that very console. You can turn this off by changing 
            this setting in <font color="#000080">user.ini</font> to true:</p>
        <p><font color="#000080">[XGame.xDeathMessage]<br>
                bNoConsoleDeathMessages=False</font></p>
        <p>The downsize is that in some team games, it might just be important to know 
            who has been fragged and who isn't.</p>
        <p>And speaking of speak messages...it's possible and completely legal to change 
            a variety of messages. Following files can be found in the \System folder, and 
            only need a basic text editor to change them:</p>
        <p><font color="#000080">Engine.int</font> (mostly menu messages, though a couple 
            appear ingame)<br>
            <font color="#000080">Gameplay.int</font> (gameplay messages)<br>
            <font color="#000080">Onslaught.int, OnslaughtFull.int</font> and OnslaughtBP.int 
            (messages used in onslaught)<br>
            <font color="#000080">XGame.int</font> (taunts and biographs from teams)<br>
            <font color="#000080">XPickups.int</font> (pickup messages)<br>
            <font color="#000080">XPlayers.int</font> (biographs from players)<br>
            <font color="#000080">XWeapons.int</font> (weapon messages)<br>
            ...and others</p>
        <p>Just make sure you don't alter the parameters themselves (these are the ones 
            with the %-sign). I don't know what'll happen, but make sure you have a backup 
            ready. Just in case...<br>
            Example: I've changed all my death messages to a same context: <font color="#008000">%o 
                got killed by %k, &lt;vehicle&gt; &lt;weapon&gt;</font>.<br>
            For the spider mines, this comes down to changing <font color="#008000">[DamTypeONSMine] 
                DeathString=&quot;%o trespassed on %k's property&quot;</font><br>
            into <font color="#008000">[DamTypeONSMine] DeathString=&quot;%o got killed 
                by %k, spider mines.&quot;</font></p>
        <h2><a name="ColorMessages"></a>Colored messages</h2>
        <p>In one of the earliest patches, Epic allowed players to color their names. 
            This wasn't perfect, as it colored the rest of message boxes in the last color 
            used (eg.: <font color="#FFFF00">P</font><font color="#FFC800">l</font><font color="#FF9600">a</font><font color="#FF6400">y</font><font color="#FF3200">e</font><font color="#FF0000">r 
                had an aneurysm</font>). There were also a couple complaints that it would make 
            things &quot;confusing&quot;, since you could color yourself in the teamcolor 
            of the enemy team. For this reason, the feature was removed in a later patch. 
            However, UTComp still allows colored names and written messages. Team names 
            can be set with the ingame menu, but for colored messages (like Teamsay <font color="#FF8040">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font> 
            <font color="#FF0000">Incoming Tanks</font> <font color="#FF8000">&lt;&lt;&lt;</font> 
            ) it's best to bind it directly to a key in the user.ini file.</p>
        <p>It works relatively easy: the first character (&quot;
            t; 
            is encountered (even in regular games, so you can use a colored name on a non-UTComp 
            server as well). The 3 color characters represent the red-green-blue color code. 
            Instead of going through trial-and-error, it's best to download <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=135058">Hyrulian's 
                UT2004 Message colorizer</a>, and copy-paste the generated string into the user.ini 
            file.</p>
        <p>Example: Teamsay grave;@@&gt;&gt;&gt;grave;&Agrave;@Node 1 is almost 
            downgrave;@@&lt;&lt;&lt; Comes down to Teamsay <font color="#FF0000">&gt;&gt;&gt;</font> 
            <font color="#FFC800">Node 1 is almost down</font> <font color="#FF0000">&lt;&lt;&lt;</font></p>
        <p>Note: if you want colors to fade from one color into the other, you'll have 
            to do some manual calculations.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Paint the first and the last letter in the correct colors. Write down the 
                red, green and blue numbers of both, and the amount of characters to fill 
                inbetween (eg. <font color="#FF0000">B</font>oom<font color="#00FF00">!</font><font color="#FFFF00"> 
                </font>; red=255, 0, 0 green=0,255,0 characters inbetween=3).</li>
                <li>Take the red values, count out the absolute difference value, and divide 
                    it with the characters<b> + 1 </b>(eg: ( | 255 - 0| ) / (3+1) = 63.75)</li>
                <li>The red values of the characters inbetween are respectively &lt;Beginvalue&gt; 
                    &lt;+ or -, depending wether the value is higher or lower&gt; &lt;character 
                    position - 1&gt; * &lt;given value in 2. &gt;<br>
                    (eg.: o= 255 - 1 * 63.75 = 191 &nbsp;&nbsp;o=255-2*63.75=127 &nbsp;&nbsp;m=255-3*63.75=63)</li>
                <li>repeat 2. and 3. for the green and blue values (eg: green; | 0 - 255 | / 
                    (3+1)= 63.75 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o=0 + 1*63.75 = 64 &nbsp;&nbsp;o=0+2*63.75=127 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;m= 0+3*63.75=191.25 )</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="StartingPoint"></a>Player starting points (mutator)</h2>
        <p>In UT2003, it was possible to use the '<font color="#004000">showall</font>' 
            command to tell you -among others- where the player starts were in a level. 
            If you're a fanatical TDM player, it is a great asset, as you can use this feature 
            to help your team to gain a lockdown on the level (basically somewhat spawn 
            raping the other team). Maybe for this reason, Epic stopped the command from 
            showing the player starts. Due to popular demand, Radiosity created a mutator 
            that shows these things to everyone. If you might benefit from this, follow
