            <h1>Predictions</h1>
            <p class=quote>If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in 
                doubt - Sun Tzu, The art of war</p>
            <p>Once you've established a certain basis of skill, you'll notice that aim isn't 
                the only skill that is used in a First Person Shooter. By now, you undoubtedly 
                found out that a rocket that is aimed perfectly at an opponent, will rarely 
                result in a hit for the simple reason that he or she has stepped aside by the 
                time the rocket arrives at the spot. This is where prediction comes in.</p>
            <h2>Prediction of players</h2>
            According to <a href="http://www.ocrana.de/utbible/">ocr*Flocutus</a>, there are 
            3 ways to predict where players are. Each of these kinds must be trained and mastered 
            to become a good FPS player.
            <h3><a name="Leading"></a>1. Leading the target</h3>
            <p>This prediction comes down to '<i>shoot where your opponent will be when the 
                    projectile hits</i>'. The rocket launcher is a classic example: if your prey 
                is running from left to right, aim more to the right. If your opponent is in 
                the air, shoot where he or she will land. And if your enemy is heading for an 
                exit or a specific item, you should aim for that position.<br>
                Both the distance to your target and the projectile speed must be taken into 
                account to calculate out how to hit your target. Even trace-hit weapons require 
                a small bit of leading: no one is born with perfect reflexes, and it will therefore 
                take some milliseconds between the brain order '<i>fire</i>' and the actual 
                firing of the gun. If you're playing online, there is even another variable 
                you have to take into acount: ping. Ping is the delay in milliseconds between 
                the contenders and the server; the higher the ping, the more you will have to 
                lead people.<br>
                Leading is so commonly used that in the end, it becomes a complete routine.</p>
            <h3><a name="Sight"></a>2. Prediction on sight</h3>
            <p>Prediction on sight is trying to predict where your target is going to, and 
                to await him or her at the destination point. It's usually easy to tell whenever 
                someone predicted you on sight: it's when you turn around a corner or go through 
                a door, and are immediately greeted with a pack of rockets or some flak.<br>
                To use this kind of prediction, you often need a good knowledge of the map, 
                because you need to be able to head off someone. Using higher ground is therefore 
                usually a good idea.<br>
                Keep in mind that prediction on sight is based completely on the element of 
                surprise, as players will act differently once they know you're on to them.</p>
            <p>Prediction on sight also has defensive purposes: if you're being chased, you 
                can turn around a corner and shoot behind you when you expect the chaser to 
                come through the place (UT2004's bots <i>still</i> follow too much, btw).</p>
            <h3><a name="Sound"></a>3. Prediction on sound</h3>
            <p>Did you ever pondered about the fact that everytime you do something, you emit 
                a specific sound? Wether it is from firing a weapon, from picking up items or 
                even simply running around, you always make a lot of noise that points at your 
                location. Listening to the sounds and using them in the game can be learned, 
                but you'll have to make a sacrifice for this one: turn off all useless sounds.<br>
                Playing without music can be strange at first, but after a while you won't even 
                notice it's gone (you can bind an alias to <a href="commands.html#Aliasses">toggle 
                    sound</a>)</p>
            <p>But there are more '1337' settings that affect your sound: go to your user.ini 
                file, search for <font color="#0000FF">bPlayOwnFootsteps</font>, and set it 
                to False. It's gonna be hard to hear other players footsteps if your own pace 
                interferes with it.<br>
                Note: you can only disable your own footsteps if you turn off weapon bobbing 
                as well (Settings-Game-Weapon bob uncheck)</p>
            <p>Another setting can be found in UT2004.ini: search for <font color="#0000FF">AmbientVolume</font>, 
                and set it to 0. This setting controls sound effects like wind, dripping water 
                and other distracting stuff.<br>
                Warning: I've noticed that Assault's alarm sounds (activate when an attacker 
                comes too close to the objective) are also controlled by this setting, so only 
                turn it off if you never play this gametype.</p>
            <p>So...What kinds of sounds will you be watching for? Simply put: <i>all of them</i>.<br>
                Weapon sounds are the most commonly predicted: change your destination whenever 
                you hear rocketfire from out of the blue. There's a good chance that it is aimed 
                directly to where you were going to. It's an extra advantage to know what weapon 
                your opponent uses, so you can adjust your combat style to it.</p>
            <p>Item pickup sounds are the best way to predict someone's position. Each weapon 
                has a unique pickup sound, but it's more likely you can tell wherever that player 
                is by listening to the direction the sound came from. Adrenaline and health 
                vials are often grouped in strings, which do a very good job of betraying positions. 
                In fact, I sometimes leave one of this 'worthless stuff' behind, just in case 
                my enemy is behind me.</p>
            <p>The sounds of power-ups are the most important ones, as they tell you an important 
                part of the enemy's arsenal (crucial in a 1on1 match). By noticing the sound 
                of power-up pickups, you can <a href="predictions.html#Timing">time</a> 
                these as well as your enemy.</p>
            <p>Finally, there are the matter of footsteps: many types of ground generate a 
                noticeable sound if you walk over them. Some metallic floors make hollow sounds 
                while wooden floors tend to crack; pools make loud splashing noises and even 
                regular stone ground echoes footsteps. All these sounds are low, so your enemy 
                must be around if you hear them. Crouching or walking stops your own sounds, 
                but you'll move slower.</p>
            <h2><a name="Other"></a>Other predictions</h2>
            <p>Predicting where players are can be a full-time job and won't leave you much 
                room for anything else to predict. However: there are more aspects of the game 
                that can be predicted. The more you know and use in the game, the better your 
                chances to win. Especially duels (1on1 Deathmatch) rely on predicting things.</p>
            <h3><a name="Timing"></a>1. Timing</h3>
            <p>Everytime an item is picked up, an internal timer starts running. No matter 
                what happens, the item will respawn after X seconds. If you can manage to remember 
                the time someone picked up a specific power-up, you might be able to get back 
                to that spot at the time it will respawn, to be able to pick up the power-up<i> 
                </i>right when it respawns. With that said, it's time to take a look at the 
                respawn times...</p>

            <p>Note that items spawn within a multiple of 27.5 seconds after they're picked 
                up. Though that makes things easier to memorize times, it doesn't make timing 
                any easier.</p>
            <p>Timing works different for <font color="#008000">vehicles</font>. Here, the 
                timer starts as soon as soon as the vehicle is destroyed, or when it dissapears 
                (aka 'despawn') after long abandoning. There was a big discussion a while back 
                on what the conditions were for empty vehicles to despawn. I don't know the 
                specific details about when this happens, though...</p>
            <p>The <font color="#FF0000">items marked in red</font> don't spawn at the beginning 
                of the match: they appear 27.5 seconds in the game. This is to prevent people 
                from rushing toward this good stuff right away, taking an important advantage 
                toward the other player(s). These power-ups are also the most important ones 
                to time.</p>
            <p>Timing happens in 4 parts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Remembering the respawn time. Take your time and don't try to memorize the 
                    whole list at once. If you can remember '<i>55 seconds for keg &amp; super 
                        shield </i>' in full combat, you're on a good start.</li>
                <li>Learning to check the timer clock whenever you pick up a power-up. The first 
                    couple times, you might want to say to yourself <i>'it is now 13:37'</i> or 
                    something, until it becomes routine.</li>
                <li>Fast calculations. Since the clock usually counts down, it's the easiest 
                    to add the remaining seconds to the next minute. Like '<i>pick up keg at ?:37 
                        -&gt; +5...so it's gonna respawn at ?: 42'</i> You can work out a routine 
                    for each one of the power-ups. If possible, do your math as soon as you pick 
                    up the stuff, but it isn't something you should do while you're in combat. 
                    When practicing this kind of timing against bots, you can pause the game to 
                    take your time to calculate.</li>
                <li>Remember to get back there at the right time. Most levels can be crossed 
                    in about 5-10 seconds, but it's always somewhat trial / error. If you run 
                    to the power-up too soon, you'll draw your opponent's attention to that place, 
                    giving him / her the chance to steal it, or at least start timing it himself 
                    / herself. If you arrive too late, that opponent might have already picked 
                    up 'your' power-up, and you will be left with just a vague assumption of when 
                    the thing is gonna come back (depends on how much too late you arrive on the 
                    scene)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3><a name="Health"></a>2. Predicting your opponent's health </h3>
            <p>It's your job to bring your opponent's life back to zero. Zero, not -124, not 
                -1...zero. I am making a point out of this because UT2004 allows you to switch 
                weapons in half a second, but I barely notice this in combat! Why do people 
                insist on shooting me with a lightning gun after they got a hit on me so I'm 
                down to 30 health? On other occasions, I had to dodge away from minigun bullets 
                while I was at 100 health. And I once had to fight off a retard who charged 
                me with a shieldgun while I was at 100 health and 100 armor. Everyone seems 
                to have a favorite weapon...Everyone but me.</p>
            <p>To predict another one's health, it's important to know what amount of damage 
                each weapon deals, so feel free to check out my <a href="weapons.html">weapons 
                    page</a>. Start out with whatever you like and shoot at anything hostile. Every 
                time one of your shots hits, you can subtract that from his/her life total (listen 
                to the hit sounds). If that estimated life total gets low, you should switch 
                to a spray weapon to finish the job. Oh, and try to block the exits: quite some 
                players tend to run off when their health goes down.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that the starting health can be higher than average. If the map 
                contains lots of health vials and armor, consider your enemy's starting health 
                at 150. The keg o'health is a power-up, so if you haven't picked it up, you 
                can be sure that he / she has (at least in duels). Armor is easier to predict: 
                hitting someone with armor sends out a slightly different sound and the person 
                glows yellow for a second. Add in 50 health to the total...or 150, if you don't 
                have the 100 armor yourself. Assuming the worst possible beginscenario makes 
                it easier to fight carefully. And you must fight cautious in a duel, as that 
                extra health status <i>will</i> make a difference. Just drain that health and 
                don't let go of him/her. Of course (s)he can run, but escaping usually don't 
                boost your health up much higher than 100.<br>
                On the other hand: in the presence of health packs can escape routes regain 
                hit points fast. Add this health by their estimated total if you fail to deny 
                it to them.<br>
                Finally: reset your estimation if you completely lose sight of your prey.</p>
            <h3><a name="Style"></a>3. Predicting your opponent's style</h3>
            <p>Each player has a predefined set of characteristics like accuracy, aggresiveness, 
                agility, tactics and weapon preference which are all fixed at a specific level 
                (not just the bots ;-) ). You should explore these settings in the course of 
                the match to find out their strong and weak points, and then try to use these 
                in your favor. If your opponent has better aim, you should try to avoid open 
                spaces and go for close combat. Find out if the other side is timing something, 
                and await him/her at the item point. Try to deny a specific weapon if your enemy 
                knocks you around with it. And how well does your opponent play if Z-axis is 
                involved?<br>
                This technique is not so pretty on pubs, where good and not-so-good players 
                are mixed up. In a Free For All DM game, it's always the new player who gets 
                picked as prime target, because these players don't defend themselves as good 
                as the others.</p>
            <h2><a name="Unpredictable"></a>Being unpredictable</h2>
            <p>I've got some bad news for you: this isn't your personal website and this material 
                is nothing but exclusive. You might think you're '1337' because you have improved 
                some knowledge on First Person Shooters, but you're just one of the millions 
                who read this page every day (well...not millions, but enough to make me feel 
                great about myself). What I'm trying to say is that in the course of the game, 
                someone will try to make some predictions on your moves and playing style...Guaranteed 
                if you're playing duels. Try demorecording once in a while and watch it afterwards. 
                While overviewing your actions, pretend you're an enemy wanting to kill that 
                character you're watching. What are his strong and weak points? How is his agility? 
                What can be improved? Does he play too cautious, or just too reckless?<br>
                Knowing yourself is just one thing; the next step is to train your weak points. 
                Luckily, UT2004 comes with dozens of mutators that can help you train in every 
                aspect of the game. Try instaGib if your aim sucks. Mix in LowGravity if you 
                want to expand your Z-axis skills. And what about the arena mutator to get better 
                at a specific weapon?<br>
                These mutators can do great work in improving your bad characteristics, which 
                will make you a better player in the end. Sometimes it's not even needed to 
                add a mutator: Devote entire matches to timing or trickjumps, while placing 
                your frag count as just an 'optional' part of the game.</p>
