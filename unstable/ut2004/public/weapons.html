            <h1>Weapons</h1>
            <p class=quote>Try turning the safety off!- Blackjack</p>
            <p>In case you're new to the Unreal franchise: every weapon in the game has 2 
                methods of firing. They have only changed a small bit since UT2003, but we'll 
                discuss this in a moment. First we have some global properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the option <i>'weapons stay'</i> makes that if you pick up a weapon, a copy 
                    will spawn immediately. You can't pick up aweapon from a spawn spot if you 
                    already posses it, but you can throw away your weapon and then pick it up 
                    (<i>eg. when you have less ammo than what you start with</i>)</li>
                <li>weapons that are thrown away will disappear after 10 seconds (this includes 
                    the weapon you drop when you die)</li>
                <li>damage is independent from the distance: every bullet or projectile will 
                    deal just as much damage from far away as from close by, as long as the player 
                    there's a hit.</li>
                <li>it doesn't matter where a player is hit on his body. The only exception 
                    is the headshot: you'll deal twice the damage if you can hit someone's head 
                    with the <a href="weapons.html#LightningGun">lightning gun</a> or <a href="weapons.html#SniperRifle">sniper 
                        rifle</a>.<br>
                </li>
                <li>besides damage, weapons also make sure that the victims are pushed aside 
                    to some extend. This property is called momentum, and it can be a big difference 
                    in <a href="ons_combat.html">infantry vs vehicle combat</a>.</li>
                <li>momentum is an important factor on levels with death zones, because in this 
                    game you are awarded the frag when you push someone over the edge.</li>
                <li>it takes 0.5 second to switch to another weapon, which is about the same 
                    speed as in Quake 3. Use this property to get <a href="predictions.html#Health">the 
                        right weapon for the right job</a>. </li>
                <li>superweapons and power-ups spawn 27.5 seconds after the beginning of the 
                    game</li>
                <li>some weapons can be charged (<a href="weapons.html#BioRifle">bio rifle</a> 
                    and <a href="weapons.html#RocketLauncher">rocket launcher</a>). While 
                    charging up you can't switch to another weapon. If you do, the weapon switch 
                    will wait until the weapon fires.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Update: I got by the damage results partially by searcing in the source code 
                and partially by shooting an empty leviathan (FF on). Just recently, Spineblaze 
                pointed me to <a href="http://gra.midco.net/thenut/weapons.html">his page</a> 
                on damage charts, which I used it to fill in some uncertainties. Boksha's explanation 
                of the shieldgun mechanics is also used (source: <a href="http://www.ataricommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?s=79ae35583aba5fb59df8ea3bf45d4844&threadid=433102">INA 
                    forums</a>).</p>
            <h2><a name="Shieldgun"></a>Shieldgun</h2>
            <p>Your basic melee weapon; every player starts out with it. It can be used to 
                pound enemies into oblivion, make big jumps or prevent  incoming damage.<br>
                <b>Prim fire</b>: holding down this button charges the weapon; upon contact 
                with an enemy, it is automatically fired...<i>if</i> you can get close enough...<br>
                <b>Alt fire</b>: it's this modus that gives the weapon its name: holding alt 
                fire will place a shield in front of the player. This shield blocks a part of 
                the damage and can even deflect shock rifle and link gun primary. The shield 
                isn't permanent: there's a meter that runs back from 100 while the weapon is 
                active (5.5 ammo/second). It also takes 15 ammo to set up the shield, and each 
                damage point it stops costs an additional 0.5 shieldgun ammo...and the double 
                if you carry the flag. The meter charges back up to 100 if the shield isn't 
                used (5.5 ammo/second).<br>
                <b>Usage:</b> this can be a good weapon in the hands of someone who knows how 
                to move. But still...it's a weapon that relies on stealth and speed, which can 
                only be safe to use in close quarters.<br>
                The shield is unique in the fact that it's the only weapon that is purely defensive, 
                which is absolutely usefull in a lot of circumstances. Remember that <i>all 
                    kinds</i> of damage are reduced, even falling damage. If you fall down from 
                high above, you can switch to this weapon, look down, and hold down alt fire 
                to reduce the falling damage.<br>
                Don't forget about your shield when you respawn in front of a fully armed enemy; 
                in combination with the spawn protection is it all you need to get out of sight.</p>
            <p><b>Remarks:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>there are a lot of good jump techniques with this weapon; check <a href="movement.html#Shieldgun">here</a> 
                    for more details</li>
                <li>the shieldgun is rarely the preffered weapon; go search for a better one 
                    as fast as you can.</li>
                <li>don't try to get a shieldgun kill if you know your opponent has a flak cannon</li>
                <li>don't try to hit someone you know is wearing an armor: you'll have to hit 
                    your prey twice, which is also twice as hard</li>
                <li>you can't charge the weapon and use the shield at the same time</li>
                <li>when playing on a server with high ping, it's possible the shieldgun automatically 
                    fires when you're close to an enemy, yet you still misses him/her. This is 
                    caused by a flaw in the network code </li>

            <h2><a name="Translocator"></a>Translocator</h2>
            <p align="left">The translocator is a portable teleporter. It comes with a throwable disc that serves as the destination point. If you transport yourself into an enemy, you'll score a frag no matter what the other player's health is. Still, this device  isn't so much a weapon, but more a means of transportation (familiars with  UT99 or UT2003 already know the impact of the translocator on the gameplay). This technique is discussed <a href="movement.html#Translocator">on this page</a>. Advanced possibilities for CTF are discussed in the <a href="ctf_guide.html#Translocator">CTF guide</a>. Here, we'll just consider the overall posibilities of the weapon. <br>
                <b>Prim fire</b>: throws the disc, or retrieves it when it's already out. Broken translocators can't be retrieved.<br>
                <b>Alt fire</b>: attempts to transport yourself to the disc. If there isn't enough room 
                to transport to (or when you try to transport into a team member), you'll hear a beep and the disc is retrieved.<br>
                <strong>Camera:</strong> if you press the translocator button while the disc is fired (Q by default), you will activate the disc's camera. This is a screen-filling image of the disc's point of view. It can be used to watch out for enemies or to time the location of the translocation better (press - in succession - prim fire, the camera button and alt fire).<br>
                <strong>Last weapon:</strong>If 
                you hold down alt fire while translocating and then press prim fire, you'll 
                switch back to your last held weapon.
                <p align="left">  <b>Remarks:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>by default, players only spawn with translocators in CTF and BR. It can't be found as a pickup weapon</li>
                        <li>by default,  throwing the ball in BR will drain the translocator (more details in the <a href="br_guide.html#Basics">BR guide</a>). </li>
                        <li>translocating into an enemy results in a frag, no matter what the health 
                            and armor of the player.</li>
                        <li>discs can be shot down with a couple shots. Trying to translocate into a broken disc results in an immediate telefrag </li>
                        <li>the camera can reveal wether the disc is destroyed: the disc is broken if 
                            there are sparks showing on the screen.</li>
                        <li>you can choose to throw the disc either in an arc or in a straight line. 
                            You do this by going to <span class="setting">Settings-Game-High beam trajectory</span> (on or off)</li>
                        <li>translocating keeps all momentum you had from before -&gt; you can't use it to save yourself from falling to your death <br>

                    <h2><a name="AssaultRifle"></a>Assault rifle</h2>
                    <p>Your main starting weapon in the game. It handles as a light variant of the 
                        minigun, since it shoots fast bullets. In contradiction to the other weapons 
                        is the alt fire a way to shoot that is completely different from the prim fire: 
                        it throws grenades.<br>
                        <b>Prim. fire</b>: shoots trace-hit bullets in rapid succession, but these spread 
                        out a lot and do only minimal damage<br>
                        <b>Alt fire</b>: throws a grenade, alternating from the left and right. The 
                        longer you hold the button, the further away you throw them. They bounce back 
                        from walls and explode on contact with players.<br>
                        <b>Usage:</b> both fire modes of this weapon are weak: the bullets don't do 
                        enough damage and are only usefull at very close range because of the spread. 
                        The grenades, on the other hand, are too small and are too easy to avoid.<br>
                        But there's one advantage to the thing: you can switch between prim and alt 
                        fire extremely fast. Hold down prim fire while you run into an opponent and 
                        throw a grenade once you're close enough to hit him / her with it.<br>
                        <b>Remarks</b>:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>get another weapon as soon as possible</li>
                        <li>the first shot of prim fire fires directly at the crosshair. Using short 
                            bursts of fire instead of holding the button might therefore be preferred 
                            if your opponent is at long distance.<br>

                    <p>Yes, it's possible to wield two assault rifles at once! Some custom maps feature 
                        assault rifle pickup spots, but the most likely way to get this is to kill someone 
                        that carries an assault rifle. Dual assault rifles increases the maximum ammo 
                        and firing rate of prim fire. Unfortunately, grenades haven't changed.<br>
                        <b>Prim. fire</b>: the same as the assault rife, but the rate of fire is almost 
                        doubled<br>
                        <b>Alt fire</b>: the same as assault rifle alt fire<br>
                        <b>Usage</b>: even with two assault rifles, the other weapons are usually the 
                        better choice. </p>

                    <h2><a name="BioRifle"></a>Bio rifle</h2>
                    <p>This is a tactical weapon. It shoots balls of slime that explode on contact 
                        with players. On a miss, the slime will remain on the floor/wall/ceiling/whatever 
                        for a couple seconds, after which it will explode. The slime will also explode 
                        if an explosive weapon is shot at it.<br>
                        <b>Prim fire</b>: shoots small slime bullets<br>
                        <b>Alt fire</b>: charges the gun up. If the button is released, the gun shoots 
                        a big and very deadly blubber. If it hits the scenery, it bursts open to 9 smaller 
                        cells.<br>
                        <b>Usage</b>: the projectiles shoot slowly and can easily be avoided. These 
                        are serious disadvantages, but if you can maintain your surprise element, this 
                        weapon can be as good as any other. Never run around with this thing without 
                        charging it up. Search for duelling opponents and throw the big ball in the 
                        center of the fight. Since these opponents are focussing on each other, there's 
                        a good chance one of them will accidentaly step into your trap.<br>
                        In 1on1 situations is this weapon only usefull in small areas: try to cover 
                        the floor with slime rather than trying to hit your opponent with bullets. Exploding 
                        slime causes a chain reaction: it detonates all slime in the area, so opponents 
                        can get killed by just stepping on one small bubble.<br>
                        Don't throw the stuff everywhere; make sure you don't corner yourself: leave 
                        an escape route for yourself.<br>
                        <p>The bio rifle is the weapon of choice when it comes to delay your opponents 
                            rather than killing them.<br>
                            If you shoot <i>directly</i> at the floor while running, the balls will drop 
                            behind you.<br>
                            <b>Remarks</b>: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Never use this weapon in big, open areas. Your enemies will just increase 
                                    the distance between you while returning fire</li>
                                <li>Slime doesn't float in water anymore</li>
                                <li>You can use the bio rifle for <a href="movement.html#Other">goo jumps</a><br>
                                </li>
                                <li>the many meshes, pipes, rocks and other irregularities in walls are a curse 
                                    for big slime balls. If you accidentaly shoot the ball in there, it won't 
                                    burst open in many small parts.<br>

                            <p>This weapon is usefull both on short, long and intermediate distances. This 
                                makes it a great all-terrain weapon, though specialized weapons are better at 
                                their territory.<br>
                                <b>Prim fire</b>: shoots a blue trace-hit beam. Note that this doesn't <i>appear</i> 
                                to be trace-hit, but the beam gets drawn <i>after</i> the arrival of the damage<br>
                                <b>Alt fire</b>: shoots a kind of bubble that isn't too easy to avoid.<br>
                                <b>Combo</b>: hit one of the bubbles with prim fire and the thing will explode, 
                                damaging everything in the area. You can even make a frag by hitting a bubble 
                                of your opponent. Beware: a combo takes 5 ammo, but can still be executed if 
                                you have between 2 and 4 ammo.<br>
                                <b>Usage</b>: never forget that there are 3 ways to use the weapon; if there's 
                                someone right next to you, you shouldn't go for that combo move (some on-line 
                                players never miss a combo, but are clueless against a shieldgun whore). Snipe 
                                when they are far away, spam the bubbles at close range, and use the combo's 
                                for mid-range.<br>
                                Since UT99 deals the weapon less damage on all parts, but the rate of fire is 
                                increased.<br>
                                The combo is kinda hard to get used to, because it requires a good aim. When 
                                using fixed aim, it's not that hard though (full combo trick guide not yet translated).<br>
                                Combo's can be executed in fast succession. In the ideal situation the passageway 
                                is small so no one can pass you, or avoid it. Furthermore, it's one of the few 
                                ways to take out enemies behind the corner.<br>

                                people that are good at following their target with the mouse. To make things 
                                worse for enemies is the fact that the beam has a negative momentum: it hinders 
                                your opponent's movement and dodge capacities.<br>
                                In onslaught has the link gun an important extra function: it can repair <a href="ons_position.html#Node">nodes</a> 
                                and vehicles, and decreases the buildtime of nodes under construction. Remember 
                                that linking up with teammates increases the power more than 2 individual beams, 
                                so keep an eye out for other linking players. <br>
                                <b>Linking up</b>: if you 'shoot' at your team mates with link gun alt fire 
                                while they are carrying a link gun as well, you'll establish a link between 
                                the two of you. This gives a bonus to the damage of the other team mate, causing 
                                him/her to deal more damage <i>and to build/repair stuff faster!<br>
                                </i>It's not that easy to tell how much that bonus is exactly, because link 
                                chains can consist of more than 2 players.<br>
                                For prim fire, the formula is as follows: <font color="#008000">damage/hit=( 
                                    1+ amount of linked players) * damage</font><br>
                                For alt fire, the formula comes down to: <font color="#008000">damage/second=(1+1.5 
                                    * amount of linked players) * damage/second</font><br>
                                <b>Usage</b>: this is a weapon that can only be used in close to medium range. 
                                Mix up the two firemodes: use prim fire if the opponent is avoiding you, to 
                                have more chance to hit him / her. If that opponent then tries to avoid these 
                                plasma bullets, use the alt fire.<br>
                                Avoid this weapon to destroy enemies in onslaught; it's better save the ammo 
                                for nodes and vehicles.<br>

                                kill yourself if you're not carefull enough<br>
                                <b>Alt fire</b>: throws a grenade that explodes on impact. This impact causes

                                very fast.<br>
                                <b>Usage</b>: this weapon is extremely powerfull at close range; either by sneaking 
                                up on someone, or just moving closer can result in a quick frag. The rate of 
                                fire is kinda slow though, and the damage from the weapon can kill yourself 
                                easily. Also: at point blank, enemies don't have to move much to get away from 
                                your crosshair, so you'll need some good reflexes.<br>

                                The use of the alt fire resembles passing a volleybal: the further away your

                            <p>All First Person Shooters come with a rocket launcher these days, and UT2004 
                                is not an exception.<br>
                                <b>Prim fire</b>: shoots rockets that can be avoided reasonably. Luckily, rockets 
                                provide some splash damage on impact.<br>
                                The weapon also has an 'autolock' function: if you can hold your cursor over 
                                your opponent for a few seconds, you'll hear a beep. If you then shoot a rocket 
                                (or start loading them with alt fire), they will bend toward the unfortunate 
                                victim. This applies for vehicle drivers as well, though <a href="weapons.html#AVRiL">AVRiL's</a> 
                                are a better choice there.<br>
                                <b>Alt fire</b>: by holding down alt fire, you'll charge up to 3 rockets, which 
                                will be shot when you release the button. At this point, the loaded rockets 
                                fly next to each other toward their goal.<br>
                                <b>Combo</b>: if you press prim fire while holding alt fire, the rockets will 
                                have a different trajectory: they will whirl around each other when flying<br>
                                <b>Usage</b>: of all the weapons, this one needs the most leading in order to 
                                make a hit. Luckily, the spash damage makes up for this inconvenience. Alt fire 
                                is preferred mostly: shooting more rockets lessens the chance of avoidance. 
                                I advice a 'normal' launch if your opponent goes from side to side from you, 
                                and a combo when he/she is avoiding you, or when he/she is close by.<br>
                                You can't really count on the 'autolock' feature: the rockets don't turn very 
                                good, so they are barely harder to avoid. Autolock is a better option in low 
                                gravity...<i>if</i> you insist in using the rocket launcher there<br>

                            <p>Introduced in UT2003 and heavily tweaked in UT2004: a sniper rifle that shoots 
                                lightning bolts.<br>
                                <b>Prim fire</b>: shoots a trace-hit lightning bolt that gives a little splash 
                                damage to whatever comes near it. If you can hit someone in the head this way, 
                                you will score twice the damage (=headshot). It also spawns a few 'child bolts' 
                                directly next to the area of impact. These are random, and the chance of hitting 
                                someone (let alone <i>two</i> players) is minimal. The damage of these things 
                                isn't clear (check <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=168331">this 
                                    thread</a> for opinions).<br>
                                <b>Alt fire</b>: a zoom that focusses your view approximately 11.5 times. A 
                                second 'shot' brings your vision back to normal<br>
                                <b>Usage</b>: like any sniper rifle, the lightning gun is made for long range 
                                fire or for quick attacks against unsuspecting victims. The bolt betrays your 
                                position, so hiding isn't a good idea with this thing.<br>
                                Remember that the headshot-part of a player is small...very small. Don't feel 
                                frustrated when it seems like you hit someone straight between the eyes and 
                                it doesn't pull off a headshot...That's just the way it is. Luckily, the weapon 
                                deals a good 70 damage on its own...<br>

                                (check the info on the <a href="weapons.html#LightningGun">lightning gun</a>)<br>

                                <b>Usage</b>: even though this weapon works similar to the lightning gun, there

                                The most important one is the fact that snipers are much harder to trace: only 
                                a small smoke flare betrays the position of the sniper.<br>
                                The second difference is that the zoom has less 'eye candy' in it, so it's better 
                                suited to overview the area.<br>
                                Finally: the sniper rifle deals only 60 damage.<br>

                            <p>This weapon of mass destruction hasn't changed much since UT99: it's a nuclear 
                                bomb that explodes as soon as it hits something.<br>
                                <b>Prim fire</b>: fires the weapon, a slow moving projectile that will cause 
                                an enormous explosion on impact. Everyone that is in the blast radius will die, 
                                except the ones on the very edge of the explosion<br>
                                <b>Alt fire</b>: a camera on the bomb allows you to steer the thing yourself. 
                                Pressing any fire button will detonate it, just like hitting something while 
                                flying. If you hold your 'walk' button while steering, you'll have it easier 
                                in the corners.<br>
                                <b>Usage</b>: the incredible firepower of this thing is only balanced a little 
                                with the few disadvantages of it.<br>
                                First of all: everyone can shoot the projectile from the sky, which causes only 
                                a small explosion.<br>
                                Secondly: this a weapon that has to be shot very cautiously when indoors, since 
                                even the slightest touch of an object will trigger the explosion.<br>

                                <p>Finally: the redeemer camera fills your entire field of view, leaving yourself 
                                    undefended. Any opponent can take you out fast, and the bomb will fizzle if 
                                    you die while steering. Therefore, make sure there's no enemy resistance around 
                                    before using alt fire.<br>
                                    <b>Remarks</b>: 
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>the explosion doesn't affect you behind walls; hide yourself if there's 
                                            going to be a redeemer blast somewhere</li>
                                        <li>the alt-fire button can't be used for an explosion at point blank range: 
                                            the projectile has to fly a couple seconds before the selfdestruct-button 
                                            is activated</li>
                                        <li>release the redeemer in open places with lots of players</li>
                                        <li>in onslaught, a redeemer can take out <i>a fully healed node</i>...And everyone

                                            important, because they have to look out for the thing and shoot it down when 
                                            it is heading for the node<br>

                                    <p>Since UT2003 is this weapon added to the arsenal of superweapons: it provides 
                                        a big blast from the sky. Don't worry if you can't spot a satellite anymore: 
                                        it is no longer required to fire this weapon.<br>
                                        <b>Prim fire</b>: paints an infrared target. If this target is hold still for 
                                        2 seconds on the ground in open air, then the blast will hit from above.<br>
                                        <b>Alt fire</b>: a zoom that focusses approx. 11.5 times. A second 'shot' brings 
                                        the field of vision back to normal<br>
                                        <b>Usage</b>: it isn't easy to use this weapon since you'll have to be (almost) 
                                        completely motionless for 2 seconds, making a sitting duck of yourself. <i>Never</i>

                                        And there are other disadvantages: the range is limited, you can't use it indoors 
                                        <i>and</i> doesn't lock when you aren't aiming straight at the ground. Luckily, 
                                        the damage area is big enough to take out everything and everyone...including 
                                        yourself, if you don't watch out.<br>

                                            <b>Usage</b>: this weapon is a perfect tool to sabotage enemy vehicles and take 
                                            down unguarded nodes. Due to the combination of a high rate of fire and big 
                                            splash damage, this weapon is even usefull in deathmatch.<br>
                                            By queueing 8 grenades on a node before detonation, you can surprise the other 
                                            team by tearing it down before they can send in backup. When attacking a node 
                                            with grenades it's best to detonate about every 5 or 6 grenades, to deny the 
                                            other team to spawn there.<br>

                                                    and drive it into an enemy vehicle. If you can time your explosion well, you

                                                a given time; if you try to add more, the first one will systematically be destroyed<br>
                                                <b>Alt fire</b>: an infrared target painter. It orders your spiders to run to

                                                <b>Usage</b>: the spiders from this weapon provides a splendid defence. These 
                                                creatures move fast but they can be taken out easy with explosive weapons (including 
                                                the minigun alt fire). When they explode, they deal even more splash damage, 
                                                which can take out adjacent spider mines with them. For this reason, you must 
                                                spread out your spiders. Only order them around if you really have to, because 
                                                that puts the spiders close together.<br>
                                                Always throw the mines in an arc: they explode if they try to deploy on unstable 
                                                terrain like nodes, vehicles, edges,... This can be painfull if you're standing

                                                <p>There is no need to keep pointing the target with the alt fire: spider mines 
                                                    will remember the point where they have to go, and they only change their direction 
                                                    if they notice someone hostile or when you give them a different order.<br>
                                                    You can throw spiders around you while running between nodes on foot. Don't
