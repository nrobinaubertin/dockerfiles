            <p class=quote>Incoming! - efficient and valuable information in the middle of a match</p>
            <p>When playing a FPS, time is of the essence. You have to be able to act and 
                react in a matter of seconds...fractions of seconds even. Getting the right 
                mindset for this is one thing, but you have to be able to move your fingers 
                to the right buttons just as fast. Luckily, computer gamers have an entire keyboard 
                at our disposal, from which all buttons can be bound to specific actions.<br>
                If there was one best key setup, then my job here would be easy: I would post 
                this setup and tell everyone to get used to it. Unfortunately, things aren't 
                that easy. Some of us can handle a separate button for each weapon and be able 
                to draw exactly the right tool for the job whenever they want, others prefer 
                to stick with a 'selectbestweapon' bind or even the &quot;nextweapon/previous 
                weapon&quot; from the mousewheel. Some use WASD as their buttons for moving 
                around, others swear by ESDF, RDFG or even use buttons that aren't shaped in 
                cross-pattern. I even know a good player who claims he still plays with his 
                arrow keys.</p>
            <p>All in all, key setup is a matter of taste. Changing your binds takes time 
                to get used to and a change is not always made for the better. Observe yourself 
                while playing: if you're constantly fumbling to get the right weapon, you should 
                add some binds. Or suppose you see an enemy run off with the flag. By the time 
                you typed '<i>Hey, I just saw the enemy flag carrier passing by here. And 'here' 
                    is on the left side, at the flak cannon</i>' that flag carrier will be gone... 
                and you will probably be dead because someone couldn't resist type killing. 
                You can bind these events to buttons as well, so you won't lose much time by 
                explaining stuff.<br>
                And there are many more examples that could help you in some situations where 
                it's either helpfull or at leastconvenient.</p>
            <p>You shouldn't bind yourself a whole new key setup at once. Take it one step 
                at a time, to allow yourself to properly remember which button gives which effect. 
                Try to group similar buttons together for easier remembering. And finally: keep 
                your most important keys (like weapon switching and -throwing) close by, and 
                put the taunts and game setting-changing buttons further away.</p>
            <p>There are 4 ways to edit your keys:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The most common way is by going to <font color="blue">'Settings-&gt;Input-&gt;Configure 
                        controls</font>' This provides only the most basic 'this action can be bound 
                    to this key'. It's fast, it's easy and it's completely useless for the more 
                    advanced keybinds.</li>
                <li>The second way is by going ingame, opening the console and typing '<font color="green">preferences</font>'. 
                    This pulls up a drop-down menu with all options that can be changed ingame. 
                    All buttons are listed alphabetically in '<font color="blue">Advanced-&gt;Raw 
                        key bindings</font>'. You can add,change or delete the command for each key 
                    individually, and immediately check the results ingame</li>
                <li>You can also bind your keys from ingame with the command '<font color="green">set 
                        input &lt;key&gt; &lt;command&gt;</font>'. This is the best way to immediately 
                    test the setting, but not convenient to bind multiple keys</li>
                <li>The last way to set keys is to go to the <font color="blue">\System</font> 
                    subfolder of UT2004 and open up <font color="blue">user.ini</font>. There, 
                    under the <font color="blue">[Engine.Input]</font> part, is the list of 
                    keys and their commands. This method doesn't require UT2004 to be running, 
                    and is therefore a lot faster than the others. The downsize of this is that 
                    you must (re)start UT2004 to check the results of your changes. This method 
                    also makes it easier to accidentaly remove a part of the .ini file that's 
                    crucial for the game.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All methods store their data in <font color="blue">\System\user.ini</font>. 
                This is also the reason why the first method of binding is explained here: if 
                you don't know the name of a button, you can still use the first method to bind 
                this key to a temporary action (like TurnLeft or turnRight). By opening user.ini 
                after setting these binds, you can easily search for this action and replace 
                it with the bind you had in mind for this one.</p>
            <p>So...now you know how to bind stuff to keys, let's find out what possibilities 
                you have in binding. I'll illustrate each possibility with an example from my 
                own user.ini file. If you want, you can even download my entire <a href="files/UT2004User.ini">user.ini</a> 
                file to examine my settings. But before we get started, take a look at the notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>it is not possible to bind dodge moves to buttons. I've seen a lot of sites 
                    about this subject, and they all agreed on this. And frankly: I'm glad for 
                    this. Proper dodging is hard, almost an art, and providing a quick fix would 
                    only give the newer players an excuse not to learn how to do this on a constant 
                    basis.</li>
                <li>square brackets ('&lt;', '&gt;') are used to serve as a spot that has to 
                    be replaced by one (and only one) character of the given type (&lt;key&gt; 
                    can be either A, <i>or</i> B, <i>or</i> shift, <i>or</i>...)</li>
                <li>The colors used in this page are as follows: green indicates a command that 
                    has to be added after the button. To give an example: <font color="green">Say 
                        &lt;any text&gt;</font> can be translated to the third key binding method 
                    as <i>&quot;</i>type the following in the command prompt:<i> set input X say 
                        I am now pressing my X button&quot;</i>, or 'copy the following into the line 
                    after &quot;X=&quot; in your user.ini file: <i>say I am now pressing my X 
                        button</i>'<br>
                    dark blue marks how to get to a certain point.</li>
                <li>all commands are case insensitive</li>
                <li>there are too many commands to list them all here. You can find out of a 
                    lot of them by binding them with the first method and then checking the syntax 
                    in the user.ini file. Others can be found on pages like <a href="All%20commands:%20http://www.planetunreal.com/ut2004/console/">this</a>, 
                    or on forums like <a href="http://www.ataricommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=408970">this 
                        one</a> (that has also some good explanation, btw). Oh, and I've explained 
                    a lot of my binds in <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=143941&highlight=idle_character02">this 
                        thread</a>...also usefull stuff.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="Buttons"></a>Advanced buttons</h2>
            <p><b>Selecting the right weapon:</b> there are 3 commands that lets you switch 
                between weapons: <font color="green">switchweapon &lt;weapon number&gt;</font>, 
                <font color="green">getweapon &lt;weapon class&gt; </font>and <font color="green">pipedswitchweapon 
                    &lt;weapon number&gt;</font>. These methods differ as follows</p>
            <ul>
                <li><font color="green">switchweapon &lt;weapon number&gt;</font> is the main 
                    choice for selecting weapons (0 for superweapons,1 for shieldgun,..., 9 for 
                    sniper rifles, 10 for translocator). However: to keep the amount of buttons 
                    down, Epic gives some weapons the same number. If you push this button, you'll 
                    switch to the weapon with the highest weapon priority (provided that you have 
                    both weapons). Pushing the button repeatedly cycles through both weapons (or 
                    three weapons, in case of switchweapons 0).</li>
                <li><font color="green">getweapon &lt;weapon class&gt;</font> selects you 
                    a <i>specific</i> weapon, or doesn't change at all. The possible weapons are 
                    as follows: <font color="green">XWeapons.shieldgun, XWeapons.assaultRifle, 
                        XWeapons.BioRifle, Onslaught.ONSMineLayer, XWeapons.Shockrifle, XWeapons.LinkGun, 
                        XWeapons.minigun, XWeapons.FlakCannon, Onslaught.ONSGrenadeLauncher, XWeapons.RocketLauncher, 
                        Onslaught.ONSAVRiL, Xweapons.Sniperrifle</font> (=Lightning gun), <font color="green">UTClassic.ClassicSniperRifle, 
                        XWeapons.painter</font> (=ion painter), <font color="green">XWeapons.redeemer</font> 
                    or <font color="green">OnslaughtFull.ONSPainter</font> (=target painter)</li>
                <li><font color="green">pipedswitchweapon &lt;weapon number&gt;</font> is 
                    a special case of the switchweapon command. It works the same, if used by 
                    itself, but if you group these together with another pipedswitchweapon command, 
                    it cycles between these two. You can also group 3 or more pipedswitchweapons, 
                    but the computer will always try to cycle between the first two, and only 
                    change if a weapon isn't available or doesn't have enough ammo.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Multiple actions bound to one button:</b> you achieve this by using the 
                '|'-symbol to separate each command.<br>
                Example: <font color="green">Use | SwitchWeapon 10</font>. This is a perfect 
                combination: ONS, vCTF and AS are played without translocator, BR and CTF without 
                vehicles. The only time this action can cause a problem is in assault, ir you 
                want to exit a vehicle at the time an objective is completed; it'll also transport 
                you straight to the new respawn spot (<font color="green">SwitchWeapon 10 
                    | use</font> prevents you from entering a vehicle at the same time the objective 
                is completed).</p>
            <p>Example: <font color="green">getweapon XWeapons.RocketLauncher | PipedSwitchWeapon 
                    7</font>. 7 is the combination flak cannon/grenade launcher, so what will happen 
                with this bind if you have two or more of these weapons? This bind is set up 
                to have the rocket launcher as a priority, so if you have it on you, you'll 
                switch to that. Pressing the button again (or pressing it for the first time 
                if you don't have the RL and ammo for it) activates the pipedswitch that will 
                give you weapon nr. 7. Which weapon this is depends on whichever has the highest 
                priority. Pressing the button again will try to select the RL again. If this 
                fails (no RL or no ammo for it), the pipedswitch is activated again, thus giving 
                you the lower priority weapon.<br>
                This is how the two commands interact with each other. For this example, I'll 
                describe the possible weapon cycling scenario's:<br>
                -one weapon: bind switches to this weapon<br>
                -RL+flak: cycles RL, flak, RL, flak, ...<br>
                -RL+grenades: cycles RL, grenades, RL, grenades, ...<br>
                -flak+grenades: cycles &lt;highest priority weapon&gt;, &lt;lowest prioriy weapon&gt;, 
                &lt;highest priority weapon&gt;, ...<br>
                -RL+grenades+flak: cycles RL, &lt;highest priority weapon&gt;, RL, &lt;highest 
                priority weapon&gt;, ...</p>
            <p>Example: <font color="green">getweapon Onslaught.ONSAVRiL | switchtolastweapon</font> 
                this continuously switches between the AVRiL and your last weapon.</p>
            <p>Example: <font color="green"> SwitchToBestWeapon | PipedSwitchWeapon 8 | 
                    PipedSwitchWeapon 7 | PipedSwitchWeapon 4 | PipedSwitchWeapon 9 | PipedSwitchWeapon 
                    3 | PipedSwitchWeapon 6 | PipedSwitchWeapon 5</font>. This is a long one, yet 
                it's purpose is simple. The first command switches you to your highest priority 
                weapon. Since the pipedswitch will only trigger once, you can see the entire 
                rest of the command as '<i>select the best weapon that isn't the highest priority 
                    weapon</i>'. So in short, this command lets you cycle between your best weapon 
                and your second best weapon.<br>
                If you want to use this command, make sure you put the entire thing in one line 
                or it will screw up. Oh, and change the numbers to fit your personal priority 
                settings (you can leave out 'pipedswitchweapon 0'...you usually don't have enough 
                superweapons to add it in)</p>
            <p><b>Change name and character:</b> you change your display name with the 'setname 
                &lt;name&gt;' command (only the first 20 characters are used for a name). If 
                you know the names of the characters, you can change these with the 'changecharacter 
                &lt;char.name&gt;' command. Note that you won't change until your next respawn. 
                These commands assume that the rest of the command line is the parameter, so 
                don't put any other commands after them.<br>
                Example: <font color="green">setname [Ci-t]Golden_Dragon</font> changes the 
                current name to [Ci-t]Golden_Dragon.<br>
                Example: <font color="green">changecharacter Motig</font> changes your skin 
                to Motig, next time you respawn.</p>
            <p><b>Actions bound to the release of a button:</b> this is done by use of the 
                'onrelease' keyword<br>
                Example: <font color="green">getweapon xweapons.shieldgun | onrelease suicide</font>. 
                There are quite some occasions in which staying alive hurts your team more than 
                committing suicide (<i>eg. when you should hurry back to the base, or when you 
                    can save a couple seconds while falling in a ravine</i>), so you really should 
                have a key for this one.<br>
                This command allows for a suicide that doesn't give your opponents any weapons 
                <i>if you hold the button down for a second</i>. However: most of the time, 
                you'll simply push the button to suicide.<br>
                Example: <font color="green">SwitchWeapon 2 | OnRelease ThrowWeapon | OnRelease 
                    SwitchToLastWeapon</font>. Many consider the assault rifle too useless to keep 
                around. So if you don't throw it away straight from the start, you can do this 
                on another occasion. Note that you'll have to keep the button pressed until 
                the AR is actually selected.</p>
            <p><b>FOV &amp; behindview:</b> Field Of View is the angle you see in front of 
                you (between 1 and 170). Normally, this is set somewhere at 90-100, but you 
                can set these on-the-fly as well (at least in off-line practice). Low FPS gives 
                a 'zoom'-effect because your view becomes limited to what is directly in front 
                of you. High FOV shows more terrain at once, which makes focussing somewhat 
                harder.<br>
                Behindview is the ability to see yourself from behind (wow...who would have 
                guessed that?). Though not very convenient, it allows for the following 'cheat':<br>
                Example: <font color="green">behindview 1 | fov 150 | onrelease behindview 
                    0 | onrelease fov 100</font>; wondering if an opponent is waiting for you around 
                the corner? Just press this button to do a quick check.<br>
                Note that in online games, the FOV is fixed to a certain number, to prevent 
                this kind of exploiting.</p>
            <p><b>No need to hold your buttons:</b> the command 'toggle' will allow you to 
                set certain actions to keep going until the button is pressed again (even if 
                you are shot inbetween).<br>
                Update: This command doesn't seem to work when entered at the command prompt, 
                so you'll have to bind it to a key<br>
                Examples:<br>
                <font color="green">toggle brun</font>: makes your character walk/run<br>
                <font color="green">toggle bduck</font>: keeps your character in a crouched 
                position<br>
                <font color="green">toggle bfire</font> or <font color="green">toggle baltfire</font>: 
                starts a spamfest</p>
            <p><b>Executing external commands:</b> If you promise not to use this command 
                to mindlessly spam the chat box with text, then I'll explain to you how the 
                'exec &lt;file&gt;' function works. You do? Well then...this command searches 
                for a file in the <font color="blue">\System</font> subfolder of UT2004 and 
                tries to evaluate all commands within that file.<br>
                Example: <font color="green">set input z exec graphic1.txt</font> (<a href="pics/graphic1.txt">contents 
                    of graphic1.txt</a>). This will show a big 'LOL' on screen...it might be somewhat 
                disfigured, but UT2004 chat wasn't designed for art, and my ASCII drawing skills 
                are close to zero.</p>
            <p><b>Changing any setting:</b> practically any setting in the game that is stored 
                in UT2004.ini or user.ini can be altered with a command. The syntax for this 
                is '<i>set &lt;class&gt; &lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;</i>'.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Classes are stored in .ini's between square brackets and usually consists 
                    of 2 parts, separated by a point (<i>eg. &quot;<font color="blue">Engine.Input</font>&quot;, 
                        found in <font color="blue">user.ini</font></i>). All lines below belong 
                    to this class...until the next class line is found (the following lines belong 
                    to this class, and so on).</li>
                <li>Variables are the left side of all the other lines, ended by the &quot;=&quot; 
                    line (<i>eg. &quot;<font color="blue">bNeverSwitchOnPickup</font>&quot;, 
                        under <font color="blue">user.ini</font></i>)</li>
                <li>The value is what's on the other side of the equals sign.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To properly use this option, you need to know the exact name of where the setting 
                is stored, and what the possible valid values are.<br>
                <font color="red">Note: entering invalid settings withing .ini files can 
                    cause problems. Always keep a backup of the file, before changing stuff.</font></p>
            <p>Example: there's a bug in the '<font color="green">togglescreenshotmode</font>' 
                command (this command allows you to remove/bring back your HUD): once you bring 
                back your HUD, your weapon hand is set to 'right hand'. You could whine against 
                Epic to fix this, or you could do it yourself: by using a command that not only 
                contains the togglescreenshot command, but also sets your weapon hand to 'hidden'.<br>
                The first step is to find out where this 'weapon hand' line is stored. After 
                some search through user.ini and UT2004.ini, you will end up with 2 possibilities: 
                <font color="green">Engine.PlayerController Handedness</font> and <font color="green">Engine.Controller 
                    Handedness</font>. To know which one affects the player hand, you should note 
                both settings, enter the game and then change the weapon hand. Go back to user.ini 
                and check which setting is changed: this is <font color="green">Engine.PlayerController 
                    Handedness</font>.<br>
                Noting the settings also gives a better idea of the valid values of a setting. 
                As you can find out from altering the setting ingame, this is done by a numbering 
                system: <font color="green">-1</font> corresponds to 'weapon hand=left', <font color="green">0</font> 
                is 'weapon hand=center', <font color="green">1</font> is 'weapon hand=right' 
                and <font color="green">2</font> is 'weapon hand=hidden'. All other settings 
                are invalid, and can cause your computer to explode for all I know ;-)<br>
                In the end, this is the complete command for a 'fixed' togglescreenshot command: 
                <font color="green">togglescreenshotmode | set Engine.PlayerController Handedness 
                    2</font><br>
                UPDATE: <font color="green">ToggleScreenshotMode|OnRelease shot|OnRelease 
                    ToggleScreenshotMode|OnRelease showgun</font> is a better way to take screenshots.</p>
            <p><b>Speeches and taunts:</b> in case you're blind and deaf: all characters have 
                some ways to curse, order other people around, dance and play with different 
                vehicle horns. If you haven't taken a look at the <a href="http://www.ataricommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=408970">INA 
                    forums page</a>, I suggest you do so now. A taunt list is also available <a href="http://www.beyondunreal.com/content/articles/22_1.php">here</a>.<br>
                Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><font color="green">speech friendlyfire 0 | teamsay ff hurts | taunt gesture_cheer</font>; 
                    makes it all the more clear that you're on the same team ;-)</li>
                <li><font color="green">playvehiclehorn 0 | randomtaunt</font> and <font color="green">playvehiclehorn 
                        1 | taunt Idle_Character01</font>. Another 'perfect match': you don't taunt 
                    while in a car, and you don't honk if you're not in a car. The Idle_Character01 
                    action depends on your character; randomtaunt does a random taunt.</li>
                <li><font color="green">teamsay grave;@@Status: grave;&Agrave;@%a, %h, 
                        %s, %w</font>: if you're playing a teamgame, this will bring up something 
                    like '<i>Status: 0 adrenaline, 100 health, 50 shield, assault rifle</i>'. 
                    You can also add the '%l' parameter (it shows your location), but this is 
                    already given in the 'teamsay' command.<br>
                    Note: the 'grave;@@' part is a remains of a patch that allowed players 
                    to add color to their name (thearacter makes the next 3 characters 
                    parameters for the color). Because of some complaints from people who got 
                    confused about which player was on which team, Epic removed this feature in 
                    their next patch. The reason why it's still used in this bind is that some 
                    servers use <a href="http://ut2004.gameamp.com/ut2004/viewUtcomp">UTComp</a>, 
                    a mutator that still allows colored names and messages. Oh, and you can find 
                    a program that allows you to choose colors <a href="http://forums.beyondunreal.com/showthread.php?t=135058&highlight=message">here</a>.</li>
                <li><font color="green">fire | onrelease taunt idle_character01</font>: this 
                    example is one of the many ideas you can do to make your character appear 
                    more funny while playing (for others; you can't see any of these effects for 
                    yourself). The idle_character01 taunt is a weapons check for the Gen Mo'Kai, 
                    so everytime you stop firing, you'll check your weapon. Note that some taunts 
                    are halted as soon as you move (and unfortunately: the weapons check is one 
                    of those), so use behindview to check if a taunt + &lt;regular action&gt; 
                    actually does anything.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Cheats: </b>most of the players find pleasure in the training ability of 
                the game, like increasing their skills, improving their aim or predicting other 
                players movements. No matter how great a game is, there are some times you don't 
                feel like playing the game to win. Some start up ONS-Tricky and try to top their 
                best daredevil score. Others find comfort in irritating other players, and (try 
                to) use aimbots to ruin games, or accuse better players of using one. And since 
                Epic understands this kind of behaviour as well, they added cheats that you 
                can use to take revenge on those damn cheating Godlike bots!<br>
                Example: <font color="green">god | loaded | allammo | summon XWeapons.redeemer 
                    | set Engine.PlayerController bAimingHelp True</font>: makes you invincible, 
                gets you all weapons and ammo, spawns an extra redeemer and puts on aiming help 
                (don't forget to set aiming help back off if you're going back to 'regular' 
                bot matches).</p>
            <p><b>Mod &amp; mutator keys:</b> mods and mutators often come with their own 
                commands to change things. The best ones extend the <font color="green">Settings 
                    - Input - Configure controls</font> menu, while others just claim whatever key 
                is available (eg. Team Arena Master). It's not hard to use these commands in 
                advanced commands, provided you know what they are (refer to the readme, or 
                bind it to an unused key and then check the user.ini file to what command it's 
                bound).<br>
                Example: <font color="green">MyMenu | menu3spn</font> &quot;MyMenu&quot; is 
                the menu from UTComp, and &quot;menu3spn&quot; is the Team Arena Master menu. 
                These two mods/mutators aren't compatible with each other, so no server will 
                have both of them running on the server. As a result, there's no reason to use 
                two different keys to get either menu.</p>
            <h2><a name="Aliasses"></a>Aliasses</h2>
            <p>Aliasses are groups of actions that are granted a certain name. They are closely 
                related to advanced buttons, but their name allows them to be used in more complex 
                tasks. Keep in mind that aliasses are limited: there are only 40 aliasses available, 
                and 32 are already used by default. It is <i>strongly</i> advised not to touch 
                these.</p>
            <p>Aliasses can be found in user.ini, in the Engine.Input-class. They have a certain 
                syntax, and you should follow this one exactly, or your alias won't do anything:<br>
                <font color="blue">Aliases[&lt;number&gt;]=(Command=&quot;&lt;line of commands&gt;&quot;,Alias=&quot;&lt;name 
                    of alias&gt;&quot;)</font> </p>
            <p>Note that the double quotation marks for are mandatory: they mark the beginning 
                and ending of the name and the list of commands. Your alias simply won't work 
                without it. To use an alias, you can simply bind a key to the name.<br>
                I'm just going to copy-paste my examples for my illustrations, to prevent the 
                syntax of becoming too complex. Make sure you change the number and/or button 
                references to use it properly.</p>
            <p><b>Switching a command:</b> suppose you have a setting you like to turn on 
                or off, depending on a given situation. You could of course bind two buttons 
                for this (one with the 'on' command, the other with the 'off' one), but why 
                do this if you have aliasses? If you create 2 aliasses and include a command 
                for each one to bind a button to change to the other one, you can use that button 
                to cycle between these actions.<br>
                Examples:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><font color="green">Aliases[32]=(Command=&quot;Set ALAudio.ALAudioSubsystem 
                        MusicVolume 0.0 | set ALAudio.ALAudioSubsystem AmbientVolume 0.0 | set input 
                        F6 MusicSFX&quot;,Alias=&quot;MusicOff&quot;)<br>
                        Aliases[33]=(Command=&quot;set ALAudio.ALAudioSubsystem AmbientVolume 0.5 
                        | set input F6 MusicOn&quot;,Alias=&quot;MusicSFX&quot;)<br>
                        Aliases[34]=(Command=&quot;Set ALAudio.ALAudioSubsystem MusicVolume 0.20 | 
                        set input F6 MusicOff&quot;,Alias=&quot;MusicOn&quot;)<br>
                        F6=MusicSFX</font><br>
                    I almost never play with music on. It distracts and muffles other sounds like 
                    footsteps and even sounds of incoming rockets. Yet there are times I just 
                    want to play with a soft background music...like when I'm trick jumping through 
                    the level. In this case, I press F6. The music gets set (ALAudio.ALAudioSubsystem 
                    is the sound level, found in UT2004.ini), and the F6 button gets set to 'press 
                    me to turn off the music'.<br>
                    The ambient volume is somewhat a dilemma: sometimes you need it, most of the 
                    time it's better left off (more info <a href="mysetup.html#Sound">here</a>). 
                    Therefore, I included it in this bind. The result of the bind is a constant 
                    cycling between these 3 states:<br>
                    1) sound effects &amp; music off<br>
                    2) only sound effects<br>
                    3) sound effects &amp; music<br>
                </li>
                <li><font color="green">Aliases[35]=(Command=&quot;demorec | stat fps | set 
                        input F4 enddemo&quot;,Alias=&quot;begindemo&quot;)<br>
                        Aliases[36]=(Command=&quot;stopdemo | stat fps | set input F4 begindemo&quot;,Alias=&quot;enddemo&quot;)<br>
                        F4=begindemo</font><br>
                    You can record demo's of your game with the 'demorec' and 'stopdemo' commands. 
                    Unfortunately, UT2004 does not provide a 'demo recording now in session' mark, 
                    so it can be confusing to know if the button started or stopped the demo if 
                    you want to record many small demo's (like...a dozen tries to make one trick 
                    jump ;-) ). That's why I included 'stats fps' in the alias. This toggles an 
                    onscreen display how much FPS you're getting. The convenience here is that 
                    you know a demo is being recorded if this display is shown.<br>
                    Note: if a level is ended, the demo automatically stops, but the bind (and 
                    the FPS notification) stays the same. Keep this in mind, because when you 
                    start the next level, the first time you'll push F4, it does nothing but turn 
                    off the FPS indicator.</li>
                <li><font color="green">Aliases[37]=(Command=&quot;set engine.playerinput

                        z=lowsens</font><br>
                    Some time ago, someone asked me for a way to increase his mouse sensitivity 
                    when he's entering a turret. I warned him that he shouldn't do this, because 
                    it would be hard to adjust to two different mouse sensitivities. But as you 
                    can see, I provided him with a button to allow for instant sensitivity increase/decrease.<br>
                    Note: 3 and 0.3 are just illustrative figures. Everyone's mouse setting is 
                    dependant on a lot of variables like the OS and the brand of the mouse. 3 
                    is my standard mouse setting, but make sure that <i>if</i> you use this alias 
                    (even though I warn against it), you replace this with your default mouse 
                    sensitivity.</li>
                <li><font color="green">Aliases[37]=(Command=&quot;switchweapon 2 | set input

                        T=Use | SwitchWeapon 10 | set input M changeSeat1</font><br>
                    Switching seats in a vehicle is easy: just press the corresponding 'switchweapon' 
                    key. Unfortunately, some players (like yours truly) like to rearrange their 
                    entire setup from time to time. Before I made this bind, I had to press 3 
                    keys in completely different parts of my N52 speedpad...Not really convenient 
                    if you're charging into battle with an empty hellbender.<br>
                    To make sure you always switch in the same order, you'll need a 'reset' function 
                    (the <font color="green"> set input M changeSeat1</font> part), which is 
                    best appended at the 'Use' key.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's about all there is to know about key binding as it applies in UT2004. 
                If you wish to know more on editing your .ini files, I suggest you visit <a href="http://www.ruination.eclipse.co.uk/ut2004/tweakbind.htm">UT2004 
                    binding/tweaking guide</a> or check the <a href="http://wiki.beyondunreal.com/wiki/Binding_Keys">wiki</a> 
                on this subject. Oh, and <a href="http://www.ataricommunity.com/forums/showthread.php?s=c4f16ead91bccd21dd32c74ede61889d&threadid=408970">this</a> 
                INA thread also contains one helluvalotof information</p>
            <p>I'd like to end this guide with a note: good keybinds just makes gaming more 
                comfortable, they don't win you the game. There are more ideas that can be 'convenient' 
                to have close by (<i>eg: a bind that pulls up the shieldgun and sets up the 
                    shield, and switches back to the previous weapon once released</i>), but I choose 
                not to describe these for a good reason: simplicity. Binding a key is one thing, 
                but learning to instinctively press it while you're under fire is something 
                completely different. And it takes about the same time to learn how to press 
                and hold that button as it would have taken you to switch to your shieldgun 
                with one button, alt-fire with a second, and finish up with your weapon-of-choice 
                key...But the second solution allows for a faster shield jumps as well.<br>
