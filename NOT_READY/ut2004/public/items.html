            <p><b>Remarks:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>while playing a team game, you won't pick up health or armor if you're maxed 
                    out. In individual games, you pick up everything except the health pack if 
                    you have 100 or more health</li>
                <li>armor works completely independent: you can pick up 1 normal and 1 super 
                    shield, but you can't increase your armor by picking up the same type of armor 
                    twice.</li>
                <li> armor stops 100% of damage if you have &gt;100, 75% if you have between 
                    50 and 100, and 50% if you have below 50 (drowning damage is an exception: 
                    this doesn't affect armor at all). Each point of armor corresponds to the 
                    same amount in health</li>
                <li>if you have both kinds of armor, then the 100 armor will drain out first</li>
                <li>you know if the person you're hitting has a kind of armor if the damage 
                    sound is different and the person flashes yellow</li>
                <li>the shield packs, damage amp and keg o'health don't spawn directly at the 
                    start of the level; they first appear 27.5 seconds in the match</li>
                <li>when carrying a damage amp, the shooting sounds have a higher tone and your 
                    weapon will have a pink glow, betraying your situation</li>
                <li>picking up a second damage amp will set the timer back to 30 seconds</li>
                <li>you're always able to pick up adrenaline, even if you have a full meter</li>
                <li>the weapon respawn only applies if 'weapons stay' is off. If 'weapons stay' 
                    is on, you can't pick up the weapon if you already have it (remember you can 
                    throw away your weapon if it has low ammo)</li>
                <li>you can't pick up ammo if you have the max. ammo for that weapon already</li>
                <li>weapon lockers don't <i>give</i> weapon ammo, but rather replenish it to 
                    a certain minimum. That's why it's best to deploy your spider mines and link 
                    up nodes <i>before</i> you pick up a weapon locker, to save more weapon ammo. 
                    The 'respawn time' is completely individual here: it doesn't apply to other 
                    players, and if you die, you can immediately pick up the weapons again.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="Adrenaline"></a>Adrenaline</h2>
            <p>The drug abuse is increased since UT2003, as the pills are now scattered throughout 
                the level. These are one way to raise your adrenaline level. If your adrenaline 
                level is high enough, you can give yourself a power-up by using some kind of 
                movement combination. Upon activating, your adrenaline lowers and the power-up 
                will remain active until the meter is depleted or until you die. The following 
                actions affect your adrenaline level:<br>

            <p><b>Remarks:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>your adrenaline level depletes twice as fast if you're carrying a flag or 
                    a ball while you're doing a combo</li>
                <li>assault and onslaught are played without adrenaline</li>
                <li>you can increase the lifetime of a combo move by gaining some more adrenaline 
                    while the combo is active</li>
                <li>if you enter a vehicle while you're doing a combo move, the combo is terminated 
                    and you keep the remaining adrenaline (only applies in vCTF)</li>
                <li>the berserk combo increases the jump height of the shield gun</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Strategies</h3>
            <p>The combo moves give an advantage over the other players, but none of them 
                turns you invincible (not even the booster). In order to keep your advantage, 
                you should wait for a good moment to use it. It's best to perform the moves 
                while you're in the air, so you won't dodge all around the place...<br>
                Booster is the most commonly used combo, as surviving is always a good idea. 
                The best time is when you aren't in combat and your health isn't too low (if 
                it is, there's a good chance your combo won't reach it's full potential). Almost 
                always the preferred choice in deathmatch, team deathmatch and especially last 
                man standing. Keep in mind that the increasing of health goes too slow to make 
                a difference in combat.<br>
                Speed is a crucial combo in CTF and BR, as it can give the carrier that extra 
                edge that is needed to outrun the defence. Unlike the others, speed is usually 
                activated in combat. Be carefull, or your run will end very fast.<br>
                Invisibility is made for snipers and people who don't want to be seen. Keep 
                in mind that even though you aren't clearly visible, other players will know 
                that you're there and will start spamming the place. Note that the flag or ball 
                doesn't turn invisible, and that the red glow of the damage amp also betrays 
                your position. In <a href="http://www.planetjailbreak.com/">Jailbreak</a>, it 
                can be a good way to sneak to the enemies' switch.<br>
                Berserk is the main choice when you're on a chaotic server (more players than 
                the adviced maximum) and have enough ammo for each weapon. It's also preferred 
                if you are holding the damage amp (faster shooting+more damage=good).<br>
                I've never used or even seen the bonus combo moves used in combat. I don't think 
                they are as good as the other ones, but to be honest: I don't know.</p>
