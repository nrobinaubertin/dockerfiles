            <h1>Onslaught Duel combat guide </h1>
            <p class=quote>Road rage! - Announcer</p>
            <p>When playing onslaught, you're in for a great deal of action, usually involving 
                vehicles. With the goal of onslaught in mind, combat doesn't get the full priority 
                over the gametype. It's all about attacking and defending nodes. Removing opponents 
                from your territory just makes things easier to achieve your goal; it doesn't 
                win you the game.</p>
            <p>But that doesn't make it an unimportant part of the game, even though many 
                guides seem to dismiss this part as self-evident. You don't need a guide to 
                tell you that it's madness to attack a leviathan on your own, now do you? However...with 
                the many types of vehicles, there are a lot of situations you can get into. 
                Is it wise to fight that opponent or is it better to drive off to another objective? 
                Each vehicle vs another vehicle requires a different approach, and it can be 
                a good thing to think each situation through. So that's what this guide will 
                deal with here. I don't think I have seen every situation yet (11*11=121 in 
                total), but luckily my imagination is good enough to estimate how a standard 
                battle would look like.</p>
            <p>I compare each vehicle with a chess piece, to illustrate you can't dismiss 
                a vehicle as being useless. Every one of them has good potential and can be 
                crucial in the right situation. And since every vehicle has a weak spot, it 
                could be interesting to know what kind of backup you could provide here.</p>
            <p> Finally, I've added a table for damage statistics. These are simply deduced 
                from timing how long it takes to destroy an empty leviathan on instant action 
                with 100% friendly fire. I've noticed that these damage stats don't apply against 
                infantry; this could be because the splash damage doesn't hit them to the fullest, 
                but I'm not sure. What I do know, however, is that infantry weapons deal less 
                damage against vehicles than on enemies.<br>
                Anyway...these stats are an estimation, not the real damage or Rate of Fire; 
                they should provide enough information to know what type is preferred (just 
                compare Damage/second from the raptor prim against the raptor alt fire). I've 
                tried reading the source code, but I got lost in the maze of classes and damage 
                types :-(</p>

            <p>The cicada is a two-seat airborne vehicle that is capable of launching guided 
                twin missiles at targets below. If you thought the raptor was hard to fly, then 
                you'll have serious problems to navigate this thing. It has a combination of 
                a low turning speed and high acceleration. This makes it hard to avoid incoming 
                fire, and the rather big size of the plane makes it an easy target for snipers 
                below.<br>
                Primary fire shoots twin missiles that travel quite slow, but deal massive damage 
                on impact. This makes it an ideal choice to take down stationary targets or 
                tanks, but rather useless to any fast vehicles.<br>
                Alt fire paints a lock on a given target; up to 16 rockets will be loaded as 
                long as alt fire is pressed, after which they are fired pretty fast. Keep in 
                mind that these missiles first travel forward a bit before they home in on their 
                target, but it's still an ideal way to take down nodes from afar. If you plan 
                to use this feature, make sure you are switched to first person mode. It's simply 
                too hard to aim correct with behindview.</p>
            <p>As said, there is a second seat available: the second person operates the laser 
                turret, a trace-hit weapon that can provide great cover below the cicada. But 
                the best thing about having a co-pilot is the fact that the turret operator 
                can fire flares that serve as a distraction for AVRiL's: these missiles follow 
                the flare rather than the cicada.</p>
            <p><u>Cicada vs cicada:</u> the projectiles go too slow to make for a good fight, 
                but this is somewhat compensated by the fact that cicada's aren't that manoeuvreable. 
                If you can surprise a floating enemy, you can do a great deal of damage to the 
                thing. Avoid dogfights; they take too long and there are so much better things 
                you can do with the thing.<br>
                <u>Cicada vs goliath:</u> goliaths move slow enough to make a prey, if you remember 
                to lead them a bit.<br>
                <u>Cicada vs hellbender:</u> I don't know (never been in the situation). The 
                hellbender can go reasonably fast, and the back cannon is a real threat (if 
                it's armed), but it's a big vehicle that can be pushed around by missiles easily<br>
                <u>Cicada vs infantry:</u> here's the main reason why you want a co-pilot: to 
                deflect incoming AVRiL's. Good players can quickly change to the second seat, 
                release a flare and switch back once they have a missile lock, but this rather 
                hard to do. Your missiles can destroy infantry fast, but you should be close 
                to make a good chance to hit someone...and if you're close, you're making an 
                easy target out of yourself.<br>
                <u>Cicada vs leviathan:</u> this plane is the best choice to destroy or severely 
                damage a leviathan. The lev is simply too big to miss, which means that a single 
                cicada can take out a full-health leviathan in less than 30 seconds (this does 
                <i>not</i> mean you should rely on a single cicada for this job). If the leviathan 
                is deployed, you can target it to make it even easier to hit the thing. <br>
                <u>Cicada vs manta:</u> hmm...slow moving missiles against the fastest vehicle 
                there is? Not likely. Avoid this situation at all costs. Go search yourself 
                a better target.<br>
                <u>Cicada vs paladin:</u> the damage of the missiles can quickly take care of 
                the shield, so don't stop firing until you're hitting the tank instead of the 
                shield. Don't forget to keep moving, 'cause that paladin will be aiming at you 
                from behind the shield.<br>
                <u>Cicada vs raptor:</u> flares can confuse AVRiL's, but not the heat-seeking 
                missiles from a raptor. Hopefully you know how to navigate fast, because that's 
                what you'll have to do in this situation. Remember that your vertical movement 
                is faster than your horizontal one, so your best bet is to change altitude. 
                Staying alive is only half the battle; unfortunately, I don't think you can 
                win the entire battle, so be prepared to fly away.<br>
                <u>Cicada vs scorpion:</u> the scorpion is small and can't target air vehicles, 
                so your best bet is move closely and lead them a lot<br>
                <u>Cicada vs SPMA:</u> if the SPMA is standing still, he hasn't seen you. Target 
                him and load up 12 rockets (=600 damage, the armor of the SPMA) and release 
                it.<br>
                <u>Cicada vs turret:</u> target it and get the hell out of there, as turrets 
                can take you down easily. Don't come back if the turret operator knows you're 
                there; you most likely won't have the time to target it properly</p>

            <p>Your basic tank has an immense firepower at his disposal, presented with the 
                possibility to zoom in to better see who you're targetting. The downsize to 
                this firepower is that tankshells are shot from the turret, and that this turret 
                doesn't turn as fast as you'd like. It also can't aim very high, making it a 
                bad choice when z-axis is involved. Close range is a bad choice as well, because 
                the shells can deal some serious splash damage to itself.</p>
            <p>Luckily, there's the second seat: this is a sidegun that can deal a reasonable 
                amount of damage to just about everyone. The only place the sidegun can't reach 
                is directly above the tank.</p>
            <p>Tanks have to be taken care of: their damage can take out nodes and enemy vehicles 
                fast, but drives slow and it is no match for a fast vehicle. Give backup to 
                your own team's tank, and work together to take out the ones from the enemy. 
                No matter what happens, don't allow this vehicle to be carjacked: even if it 
                is damaged too much to be used against you, simply by denying you the tank, 
                they cripple your team badly.</p>
            <p><u>Goliath vs cicada:</u> only try this if they haven't seen you; if you can 
                knock it out, you'll get an <i>eagle eye</i> award. If they have seen you, then 
                you better leave the tank fast, because they destroy it in no time. Switching 
                to the sidegun only speeds up this process, because the tank won't move anymore.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs goliath<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:</font></u> 
                this can be fun. Get the first shot and make sure your avoiding manoeuvres don't 
                include changes in heigth. 3 shots take out another tank, so prepare to take 
                some backfire. You can predict a defeat almost 2 seconds before it actually 
                happens, but unfortunately that's rarely enough time to escape the tank.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs hellbender:</u> hit the front and you'll take out the driver. 
                Hit the wheels and you'll flip it over. Hit it twice and it's destroyed.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs infantry:</u> foot soldiers are small and can hide easy. Use the 
                cannon for long range shots and the sidegun for close infantry. If they manage 
                to get on your blind spot, you must jump out as soon as your health goes below 
                100. Immediately turn around and destroy the tank if they carjack it.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs leviathan:</u> try to remain hidden until some team mates arrive. 
                That's when you should start pounding on the thing. Your have quite some armor 
                so you can expect to deal some damage to it. If the lev is deployed, you can 
                be sure it will target you. Team mates should take distance from you.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs manta:</u> one of the more close fights in onslaught. Any good 
                manta driver will use his speed and agility to keep away from your turret. But 
                it isn't easy for them to perform a perfect circle strafe while keeping their 
                focus on you. Try to lead them so you can shoot somewhere near the manta when 
                it comes down from a jump, killing the driver with the splash damage. If the 
                manta keeps at long distance and there's no other enemy around, you can exit 
                the vehicle and send an AVRiL their way (prepare to quickly hop back in). The 
                side gun is better to target them, but deals very little damage to them; only 
                switch seats if the manta is almost destroyed.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs paladin:</u> keep your distance, no matter what. Keep your aim 
                on the tank (in case he decides to shoot at someone) while you slowly take out 
                their shield. Having backup will speed things up alot.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs raptor:</u> like with the cicada situation: only go for an <i>eagle 
                    eye</i> award if he/she hasn't spotted you. You have lost the fight the moment 
                the raptor targets you from directly above you. You can switch to gunner positions 
                to go for a few small hits, but your main goal is the armor bar: get ready to 
                leave the vehicle once the health goes below 100, and get away from the thing 
                quickly when it happens. (updated. Thanks, Jovian)<br>
                <u>Goliath vs SPMA:</u> SPMA's aren't made for combat. Try to hit the front 
                of the thing, to deal some damage to the driver or co-pilot.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs scorpion:</u> another easy prey. If you lead them a bit it's easy 
                to kill the vehicle, or at least the driver.<br>
                <u>Goliath vs turret:</u> 2 simple shots take out a turret, but it's hard to 
                imagine that a turret operator will miss you in this time. Don't forget to take 
                a <i>single</i> shot at empty turrets as well. This way, you can take them down 
                faster once they do get manned</p>

            <p>With 3 different seats, it's no wonder that the hellbender is the toughest 
                one to master. The first step towards this is the knowledge that you can change 
                seats at any time (unless you have a <i>human</i> crew with you; bots will switch 
                seats with you). When used this way, the vehicle has more advantages than simply 
                being a transport vehicle. The most common one-person use is as a moveable turret. 
                The cannon takes long to aim, but with the element of surprise it can clear 
                out the entire sky.<br>
                The other (and IMO even better) use is as creature sweeper. Drive straight into 
                a pack of enemy infantry, change to the turret and combo out everyone in the 
                area before your vehicle has even stopped. After that, just switch back and 
                proceed as a driver.</p>
            <p>The vehicle horn of the hellbender might seem useless, but it has become the 
                international sign for '<i>hey you over there. Get in!</i>' Bots follow this 
                approach since the demo days, and humans eagerly followed their example.<br>
                When driving with passengers, things are somewhat harder: try to keep driving 
                in a straight line if possible; it makes fixed aiming for the cannonneer a lot 
                easier. Also make sure you know where you're going: you can waste/spend more 
                than your own deal of time here, so heading in the wrong direction will have 
                a larger impact on the course of the game. You are <i>not</i> responsible for 
                people who die because of enemy fire: everyone should keep an eye out for the 
                health and leave before it gets destroyed.</p>
            <p>If you can get close to an enemy node, make sure to switch to the turret seat: 
                short range combo's between the node base and the circle will drain its health 
                quickly. </p>
            <p><u>Hellbender vs cicada:</u> cicada's usually have better targets to fight 
                than a hellbender, so take your time to let your cannoneer deal 200 damage to 
                the thing (slow down if you have to). Since trace-hit weapons are the best choice 
                against cicada's, the hellbender is even a better choice than before to defend 
                a node.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs goliath:</u> not a chance. The cannon takes way too long to 
                load and the turret can't do more than scratch the tank's surface. Avoid an 
                encounter like this <i>at all costs</i>. All occupants must leave the vehicle 
                ASAP.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs hellbender:</u> I like this one; most of the fights end up 
                in one car getting tipped over by the cannon of the other car, or when the drivers 
                hit each other. On close combat, quickly switch to turret and prim fire him 
                down. These fights are usually won by the hellbenders with the most crew.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs infantry:</u> at long range, you can stop the hellbender and 
                start sniping at infantry from afar. At close range, turrets can clear out infantry 
                with their combo attack. At point blank range, the driver can simply run over 
                them. Conclusion: a hellbender is good against infantry<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs leviathan:</u> can't remember seeing this one, but the outcome 
                is obvious. Everyone should get out of the 'bender and deal the most damage 
                they can on foot, hoping that the leviathan targets the empty hellbender first.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs manta:</u> remain hidden as long as possible. Stop the car 
                and let the cannonneer take his time sniping. He should shoot when the manta 
                isn't going from side to side (too fast). If the manta targets you, try to squeeze 
                him between sky mines. If he comes close by these, combo it.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs paladin:</u> hmm...not the best fight: it can deal great damage 
                at you, but not the other way around. With more passengers, you should get out 
                and attack, using different aproaches.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs raptor:</u> using the element of surprise is key here. Load 
                up the cannons, aim carefully and wait until it hangs still. If you hit it, 
                it will get thrown back and get disoriented. Use this to your advantage to keep 
                hitting it with the cannon; shoot whenever you have a clean shot.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs scorpion:</u> easy from afar (the cannon again), but quite 
                tough at close range, since it can cover you with bola's easily. Leave the vehicle 
                if you don't think you'll have enough armor left.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs SPMA:</u> if you have rockets and/or AVRiL's in your inventory, 
                I advise to exit and go shoot at it from a safe distance to destroy the SPMA 
                the fastest way. Otherwise, you're forced to use skymine prim fire or the cannon 
                to destroy it.<br>
                <u>Hellbender vs turret:</u> the hellbender is simply too big to miss. Get out 
                and try taking it down on foot before it takes you down. If you can destroy 
                it, you can get back in the hellbender</p>
            <h2><a name="Infantry"></a>Infantry (pawn)</h2>
            <p>Easily the most underestimated piece of the bunch. After some months of AVRiL'ing, 
                I can safely say that decent infantry can take down anything. But here's the 
                thing: it takes a lot of practicing to become good enough to fully qualify as 
                'good infantry'. Many aspects of being infantry can be learned in other gametypes, 
                but for onslaught, the accent lies on two things: alertness and agility.<br>
                If you aren't alert, then it's only a matter of time before vehicles run you 
                over. Always face the direction where enemies are going to come from, position 
                yourself against a wall or on top of a vehicle to make drive-by's harder.<br>
                Agility is the skill to react and adapt fast enough to stay alive in all situations. 
                With proper <a href="movement.html">movement skills</a>, you can easily 
                keep up with a goliath.</p>
            <p>Dealing damage against vehicles requires you to deal the most damage/seconds 
                as possible. Take the <a href="weapons.html#AVRiL">AVRiL</a> for example: it 
                has a long reload time, but you can still switch weapons between them. Mix up 
                AVRiL rockets with regular ones to deal a massive amount of damage against tanks.</p>
            <p><u>Infantry vs cicada:</u> cicada's <i>do</i> have a way to distract AVRiL's 
                (the co-pilot's flares), but these get rarely used. In my experience, about 
                1 in 5 AVRiL's get distracted by flares, so if you lock on them at the last 
                moment, you'll usually make a hit (maybe cicada pilots haven't found the usefullness 
                about this feature yet). If they do get distracted, it's advised to switch to 
                hit-scan weapons (shock prim is a good choice)<br>
                <u>Infantry vs goliath:</u> at long range you must use the terrain to hide out. 
                If you can't see it, it usually can't hit you. The closer you can get, the better 
                your chances. Circle strafe around it and avoid the turret while you hammer 
                on it with flak, grenades or rockets.<br>
                For the experts: try to jump directly on top of the tank. There's a blind spot 
                where even the side turret can't hit you <br>
                <u>Infantry vs hellbender:</u> if possible, keep your distance. The cannon is 
                a threat, but it takes some time to charge up. Don't stop dodging sideways while 
                you AVRiL the thing. If someone is manning the turret, he can shoot down your 
                incoming AVRiL's. Use regular rockets in this case.<br>
                Stay away from turret mines. Their range is big and they do serious damage, 
                so you don't want to stay around.<br>
                If the hellbender drives to you, you're going to need some steel nerves. If 
                there aren't hiding spots, <i>don't</i> simply run away. It will catch you no 
                matter where you're running to. Your only chance is to dodgejump sideways <i>at 
                    the last moment</i>. I don't think you can escape death if there's also a turret 
                operator at that time...<br>
                <u>Infantry vs infantry</u>: the noble art of DM must be about 10 years by now, 
                so there's more than enough info out there that explains you some things about 
                this (hey...try these <a href="movement.html">movement</a> and <a href="weapons.html">weapons</a> 
                guides while you're at it). For onslaught, keep the following in mind:<br>
                -the terrain will be very open<br>
                -the weapon lockers gives everyone a variety of weapons. Use these to your advantage<br>
                -onslaught is <i>not</i> deathmatch; destroying nodes or even linking them up 
                (in defense) is your primary goal; killing the opponent just makes this goal 
                easier to accomplish<br>
                <u>Infantry vs leviathan:</u> Eehm...remember what I said about infantry taking 
                down anything? I lied...You simply can not do this on your own. However, you 
                have the choice here: dying while trying to outrun the levi, or dying while 
                trying to prove to me that you <i>can</i> take down anything as infantry. The 
                good news is that leviathan's are impossible to miss at close to medium range. 
                More good news is that leviathans usually have better targets than infantry, 
                so launch your strike against it when there are team members helping you. Two 
                players have more than double the chance to destroy it, because the levi can 
                only shoot one enemy at a time.<br>
                Note: not even a redeemer can destroy a leviathan, so save it for nodes.<br>
                <u>Infantry vs manta:</u> you undoubtedly know these things are <i>fast</i> 
                and can crush you in the blink of an eye. So how do you even start to fight 
                these things? Simple: turn the music off. As soon as you hear that hovering 
                sound, dodge away from the side you think it's going to come.<br>
                When the manta is far away, then well-lead AVRiL's are the best way to deal 
                with them. If the manta is close by, then it's a job for your shock rifle or 
                (less prefered) your flak cannon. Aim carefully while the thing storms right 
                at you and shoot either a shock ball or primary flak at the last moment. A hit 
                will stop the manta almost completely; at this point you must keep spamming 
                at it until it is destroyed. With the shock rifle, switch to prim fire once 
                the manta gets on far range.<br>
                <u>Infantry vs paladin:</u> keep your distance at all times while you weaken 
                the shield. Never stop moving, because the paladin can lower the shield and 
                immediately shoot at you. If you have backup with you, you should surround the 
                paladin to get behind the shield, but keep your distance so the paladin's combo 
                can't get you.<br>
                <u>Infantry vs raptor:</u> well-lead AVRiL's are the way to go. If you don't 
                have it, you can use other trace-hit weapons (like prim shock) to knock the 
                raptors around.<br>
                <u>Infantry vs scorpion:</u> with the 2 deadly blades, the scorpion looks more 
                dangerous than it is. Double jump toward it if you see it coming (or even just 
                hear it) and you will get right over the vehicle. Regular rockets work even 
                better than AVRiL's here, because the momentum will seriously desorientate the 
                vehicle. Don't allow the scorpion to gain speed by circle strafing around it. 
                If they tangle you in bola's, you're most likely not going to survive. The only 
                chance is to stretch out the wire, which will spread out the damage (thus damaging 
                you less).<br>
                <u>Infantry vs SPMA:</u> remember that the SPMA has a turret like the hellbender, 
                so stay at a distance. You can abuse the SPMA's camera on two ways:<br>
                1) aim your AVRiL's at it: they will divert toward the vehicle (not as good 
                as it sounds...until now, I never took out an SPMA this way)<br>
                2) shoot it down with a single shot from any gun (trace-hit is preferred).<br>
                <u>infantry vs turret:</u> AVRiL's and rockets gets the job done easy. One small 
                beep is enough to shoot an AVRiL straight toward your target. Since one of the 
                patches, AVRiL's reassume their initial course when they are no longer guided, 
                so get the lock on the turret <i>before</i> you shoot. Oh, and always keep moving: 
                you're making it too easy by remaining motionless.</p>

            <p>Levi's can make and break games. Just like the chess counterpart, you should 
                be aware of her position at any time. Inform your team mates about the whereabouts 
                of (friendly) leviathans; it gives a good idea which parts of the map are safe 
                and which are dangerous. She can destroy anyone, but not everyone at once. Enemies 
                should group together to take it down, because she'll win any duel you put her 
                against (except maybe another levi).</p>
            <p>The additional 4 seats don't indicate that you should fill it up...ever. With 
                5 persons in the tank, no one will be able to knock it down, but once again: 
                onslaught isn't deathmatch. The other team will simply get around the levi, 
                and by the time she arrives at a node, it will be locked because nobody was 
                left on the defence. Besides...infantry can keep up with the tank easily (if 
                they <a href="movement.html#Various">dodgejumpwalk</a>) and an AVRiL is 
                more effective than the plasma turrets, so the plasma turrets are pretty useless. 
                The only use I can think for them is while the tank is deploying: the driver 
                can't move or shoot at this time, but he can still change seats. So he can switch 
                to the 2nd seat, dish out a little damage, switch back to first seat to activate 
                the ion cannon, switch back while the cannon is firing, and so on...</p>
            <p>I think it's pretty obvious you should never abandon the tank (unless under 
                100 armor): a carjacking will turn the entire game around.<br>
                Note: the sidegun turret operators can be hit when the leviathan is deployed<br>
                Note: the ion cannon doesn't damage team mates, even if team damage is on</p>
            <p><u>Leviathan vs cicada:</u> enemy cicada's should be your first priority, because 
                they can deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time. I hope you're not deployed, 
                because that's going to hurt... <br>
                <u>Leviathan vs goliath:</u> the goliath's projectiles travel faster than yours, 
                meaning the distancance is in your disadvantage. Otherwise, they don't pose 
                much of a threat, especially not when you're deployed...<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs hellbender:</u> nothing to worry<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs infantry:</u> if they can get close to you, they can do quite 
                some damage (relatively speaking). Your projectiles also aren't that effective 
                at point blank range.<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs leviathan:</u> the best weapon in the game is the ion cannon, 
                so the lev that is deployed first will win. Never engage combat against a deployed 
                one; instead deploy yourself if you see one coming your way. This situation 
                is of course very rare: even if the map features two levi's, then there's close 
                to no chance they will have a 1on1 fight.<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs manta:</u> these fast vehicles can outrun your missiles without 
                much trouble, so send your missiles all around them. They will lock on to the 
                enemy when they get close. I've heard that a manta pilot can drop out on top 
                of you, where you can't touch him/her (except by deploying and ion blasting 
                yourself)<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs paladin:</u> paladins usually guard nodes, so deploy your tank 
                and check out how much damage their shield can take. I guess not more than 1 
                shot, but I haven't seen this in the game<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs raptor:</u> the turret and the wheels work completely independant, 
                so you can drive in one direction, and look all around you to target the raptor...Just 
                make sure you're not heading straight off a cliff or into a wall. Just as with 
                the manta, shoot all around them to have the most chance to actually hit them.<br>
                As a sidegunner, you must exit and use your AVRiL...the plasma turret projectiles 
                travel too slow to hit the raptor.<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs scorpion:</u> bolas can deal a lot of damage/second; luckily, 
                scorpions can be destroyed fast.<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs SPMA:</u> nothing to worry...as long as you can see it coming<br>
                <u>Leviathan vs turret:</u> take them out if there aren't worse threats around; 
                the projectiles even lock on empty turrets</p>

            <p>Your can describe the manta in 3 words: fast, agile and anti-infantry...or 
                are those 4 words? Anyway...this makes the manta a perfect choice for sneak 
                attacks, base rapes, scouting jobs and occasional backup. Add in the ability 
                to jump and float, and you'll have yourself a vehicle you can call airborne 
                (the manta also hovers over water).</p>
            <p>The main disadvantage is the armor...Or rather the lacking of it: a single 
                AVRiL can take you down, so better exit the vehicle fast if you get a missile 
                lock. If you're really lucky, the AVRiL hits a wing, which will cause only about 
                150-180 damage.<br>
                The second disadvantage is the slow turning speed. The manta has roughly the 
                same speed forwards as sideways and backwards. Use this to your advantage when 
                running away (and a good manta driver knows when to get away from the scene): 
                first build up some speed in the direction you'll need to escape, and turn <i>afterwards</i>, 
                used with a jump and a circle strafe in the air.</p>
            <p>The manta is able to jump, but only if the meter on the HUD is charged and 
                the wings are in a good position to take off from. The jump height is proportionate 
                to the distance to the ground: you'll go a tiny bit higher than normal if you 
                jump directly after a crouch, or when you just got in the thing.<br>
                Another aspect of this jump technique is that you can gain air by grinding up 
                a slope: time your jumps at the end of the slope to make the highest jumps.<br>
                Due to their light size, they can cover a great distance while floating. Only 
                use the crouch or alt fire button when you have to crush infantry.</p>
            <p>The most important aspect of this vehicle is carpooling. It can carry many 
                passengers on its wing and back, and when used correctly at the start of the 
                game, then it can give you a great speed bonus (even a complete node bonus if 
                the other team doesn't do this). Here's how to do this: hurry to the manta and 
                jump on top of it (the top is more stable than the wings, btw). <i>Don't get 
                    behind the wheel yet!</i> Look around to see wether team members are coming 
                your way. If there are, <i>they</i> will drive you to the node. If there aren't...well, 
                5 or 6 seconds of teamplay didn't hurt that much now, did it?</p>
            <p><u>Manta vs cicada:</u> a null operation: manta's can't shoot at cicadas, and 
                as long as you keep moving they won't hit you. Get out and find something you 
                <i>can</i> hit.<br>
                <u>Manta vs goliath:</u> avoid the cannon turret at all costs and keep your 
                aim fixed to the tank. <i>Never stop moving!</i> Circle strafe around the tank 
                and only jump when you're in danger. Jump <i>toward</i> the tank if you're going 
                to be cornered: manta's turn around slow, but their turret is even slower.<br>
                <u>Manta vs hellbender:</u> easy targets, if you'll keep them targetted. Their 
                cannon can take you out with one punch, so move side to side from the hellbender 
                instead of back and forth. If there is nobody operating the turret, you can 
                rush straight toward them, crouch and hit them. If you do it right, you'll push 
                the hellbender straight on its side. If there is a turret operator, you should 
                keep at a safe distance: a single combo can take you out<br>
                <u>Manta vs infantry:</u> the most common type of combat in onslaught (maybe 
                with the exception of infantry vs infantry). Manta's are <i>excellent</i> to 
                quickly get rid of infantry. Good players can make a fine defence, though. Therefore, 
                try to sneak up on them. If you see people linking up a node, don't shoot while 
                you're coming over. Jump right in front of them and run them over before they 
                can react.<br>
                Be on the alert if they actually take their shock rifle. This means they know 
                how to handle you! Don't go for another driveby, but start shooting them instead.<br>
                On some occasions, you'll have a sudden missile lock from out of the blue. If 
                possible, get it to a hiding spot. Otherwise:<i> leave the vehicle</i>.<br>
                If you do know where the AVRiL rocket is coming from then you can predict where 
                you will be safe. If there isn't such a place around you must play matador with 
                the thing. Jump slightly <i>before</i> the last moment and quickly duck (the 
                AVRiL goes over you, then straight into the ground), or corner yourself so the 
                missile will hit the wall if it misses you.<br>
                <u>Manta vs leviathan:</u> keep your distance while shooting at it. If possible, 
                wait for your team to arrive before attacking. It might be possible to land 
                on top of the leviathan so it can't reach you without deploying (as said in 
                <i>lev vs manta</i>)<br>
                <u>Manta vs manta:</u> as said, the manta is extremely fast and agile. Put one 
                manta against an other and you'll have a fight that can take a looooong time. 
                Exiting your vehicle isn't an option either since infantry vs manta is too hard. 
                Avoid this situation when you're defending; a manta is a bad choice for defence 
                anyway. On offence, simply pick another target and never stop moving.<br>
                Remember that the manta is good for <i>stealth</i> attacks. If you see a manta 
                attacking something, quickly shoot at the cockpit before he notices you. The 
                3 or 4 hits you score can be enough to give you the advantage to win you the 
                fight.<br>
                <u>Manta vs paladin:</u> this can take a while if you're alone: you have to 
                keep moving to prevent the tank to take a good shot, while very slowly tearing 
                down the shield. If you have backup, you must try to surround the paladin, so 
                at least one of you can get behind the shield<br>
                <u>Manta vs raptor:</u> as good as impossible. Try to outrun the raptor, but 
                beware of the homing rockets.<br>
                <u>Manta vs scorpion:</u> warning! Scorpion bola gets sucked in your wings, 
                which will kill you in a matter of seconds (even with the smallest hit). Therefore 
                you must always stay back against these, and exit your vehicle as soon as some 
                bola covers your vehicle. Allow me to repeat that last part: <i>exit the vehicle 
                    when it's covered with bola!</i> I can't even count how many times people kept 
                flying with a corrupted manta.<br>
                Try to hit the face: it will hit the driver's health as well<br>
                <u>Manta vs SPMA:</u> SPMA's are easy targets. Their sound, the camera and the 
                angle of dropping bombs are good clues to where the SPMA is hiding. As a manta 
                driver, it is your duty to track that vehicle down and destroy it, before it 
                deals too much damage to your home node or core.<br>
                <u>Manta vs turret:</u> turrets have a good knockback against mantas, so avoid 
                these encounters. Stay at a distance and move side to side, but you'll stand 
                a better chance on foot. At close range it's an even worse idea to use a manta. 
                Get a better target or get out of there.<br>

            <p>With all this firepower in the game, it's good to have a vehicle that is used 
                primary for defence: the paladin. Sure, it can fire an energy bolt that does 
                reasonable damage, but the shield is the main strength of the thing.</p>
            <p>Prim fire is a weak version of the goliath tank: an fast-traveling energy ball, 
                shot from an adjustable turret. There is no zoom feature, so aiming will be 
                a bit harder on long distances. It's a better choice on short distances, because 
                the energy ball doesn't damage itself on a point blank shot.</p>
            <p>By holding alt fire, you create a large shield in front of you - it's transparent, 
                so you can still see what's going on. By positioning the tank close to a node, 
                you thoroughly prevent enemies from taking a shot at it. The shield can take 
                about 2000 damage (more than a redeemer!), so your team has time enough to aid 
                you to hold off the attack wave.<br>
                If your tank survives an attack wave, you can quickly recharge your shields: 
                it begins recharging one second after you've lowered your shield (it takes maximum 
                5 seconds to recharge completely).</p>
            <p>The prim fire isn't that important, but can be used in co-operation with the 
                shield: you can take your time to aim at your target from behind the shield, 
                lower it and immediately shoot. The downsize to this is that your tank is vulnerable 
                for 2 seconds after the shot (it'll be partially healed by then).</p>
            <p>The combo is even more important: shoot <i>against your own shield</i>. This 
                will pop the shot against the shield and scatter the damage around your vehicle...This 
                is a good way to deal with enemies who come too close to the shield.</p>
            <p><u>Paladin vs cicada:</u> hope he doesn't see you: it's easy to hit a cicada 
                that holds still to pick on a target, but almost impossible to hit it while 
                it's moving. Its missiles can drain your shield and armor fast as well, so be 
                prepared to abandon the tank once the shield goes down.<br>
                <u>Paladin vs goliath:</u> one of the more interesting fights: set up the shield, 
                drive your tank as close to the goliath as possible and start combo-ing. They 
                can't shoot back without dealing more self damage than damage to your shield, 
                and your combo's slowly drain the tank (I think...not completely sure) <br>
                <u>Paladin vs hellbender:</u> hellbenders don't deal enough damage to seriously 
                break down the shield (they can't do multiple skymine combo's against it), so 
                you can hold it off for a long time. Only lower the shield if you have a clear 
                shot <i>and</i> are able to reset the shield without taking too much damage 
                inbetween<br>
                <u>Paladin vs infantry:</u> an easy prey, both on short range (shield combo) 
                as on long range (one straight hit). Most infantry will try to get around the 
                shield, keep the shield between you and the opponents.<br>
                <u>Paladin vs leviathan:</u> I don't know if it's possible to survive one direct 
                ion blast, but you don't have a choice - you're too slow to outrun this thing. 
                Don't try to take a shot at it: you'll need to distract the leviathan as long 
                as possible, and the best way to do this is by keeping the shields up.<br>
                <u>Paladin vs manta:</u> these can be a plague if there are multiple enemies. 
                Manta's will almost always find a way to get to your unshielded side. You can 
                try to lead them when they're going slower (in a similar way as the goliath 
                tank), to take on the driver. The risk is pretty high, though: your shield will 
                be down for 2 seconds, so only shoot if you're sure you won't miss!<br>
                <u>Paladin vs paladin:</u> I don't think this will happen often, as the paladin 
                is a <i>defensive</i> vehicle. This is shown here clearly: both sides put their 
                shields up, and the first one to lower it will lose because he can't put the 
                shield back in time before the other tank has a <i>clear</i> shot...which will 
                give the first tank a clear shot again, and so on. These duels (if they happen 
                in the first place) take way too much time not to be interrupted by other players.<br>
                <u>Paladin vs raptor:</u> don't even try this. It's hard to hit and you'll make 
                an easy target out of yourself. Just set up the shield as an umbrella and hope 
                that a team mate will take care of it.<br>
                <u>Paladin vs scorpion:</u> scorpions are fun to push around with your gun, 
                and there isn't much they can do about it. The bola's travel slowly, so it's 
                unlikely that they'll ever pass by the shield. And if they try to come too close, 
                then you'll welcome them with combo's.<br>
                <u>Paladin vs SPMA:</u> this depends on the distance: on long range, your job 
                is to stop the incoming bombs from dropping on your node and teammates. If you're 
                close (for some reason...don't really see a situation how this would happen), 
                you can easily shoot the front to damage/kill the tank or the driver. Skymines 
                don't really pose a thread for the paladin.<br>
                <u>Paladin vs turret:</u> distraction time! While the turret is pounding down 
                your shield, it isn't pounding on whatever else is heading in the direction 
                of the turret. You can even take the time to aim carefully and place a direct 
                shot: trading damage will be worth the time if it helps to stop the turret from 
                choosing a better target.</p>

            <p>The raptor is the other 'real' airborne vehicle in the game. Though easier 
                to navigate than the cicada, it still takes some practice to get used to. Once 
                mastered the moves, it's a great and fast scouting vehicle that can aid your 
                team well to reach neutral power nodes quickly.</p>
            <p>The prim fire is a standard gun that can be compared to the one of the manta. 
                It makes a good damage/second, but to make it all count, you should be really 
                close to the ground...and because raptors have low armor, you shouldn't do this 
                often.<br>
                The alt fire is a missile launcher. When shot, this projectile will automatically 
                lock in on nearby cicada's, raptors and manta's (even empty ones), provided 
                that they are close to your crosshair the moment you shoot it. The prey gets 
                a 'missile lock'-warning, just as though it was an AVRiL missile. Raptor missiles 
                don't track that well and don't deal that much damage, though...</p>
            <p>Update: found <a href="http://www.teamk1.com/onslaught/viewtopic.php?t=119">this 
                    thread</a> with more interesting tips</p>
            <p><u>Raptor vs cicada:</u> flares won't stop your missiles, so make full use 
                of this fire mode. Even if they manage to avoid your missiles, they won't have 
                time to do anything but surviving.<br>
                <u>Raptor vs goliath:</u> as said before, the goliath has a blind spot directly 
                above it. Get there and you won't have any trouble taking it down. This is a 
                high priority job, because other vehicles have it much harder against the goliath.<br>
                <u>Raptor vs hellbender:</u> you have to watch out for these. One hit from the 
                cannon gets you 200 damage, and they have a <i>big</i> reach. Close combat is 
                even worse because of their turret. So keep circling around it in midrange, 
                or get close if there's only a driver.<br>
                <u>Raptor vs infantry:</u> these are the worst enemies: hard to shoot (too small, 
                seen from above), but they can lock in on you without giving you a chance to 
                escape. Only start a fight with infantry if you know for sure they won't have 
                an AVRiL. Snipers are another threat, as they can knock you around much. Stay 
                low; this makes for easier targetting, a possibility to run them over and a 
                better exit than when you're high above.<br>
                Don't hesitate to jump out when your health gets low. Use your <a href="weapons.html#Shieldgun">shieldgun</a> 
                to reduce falling damage.<br>
                <u>Raptor vs leviathan:</u> one of the better vehicles to take on a levi. Keep 
                circling around them to avoid their fire, while keeping your lock on the thing. 
                As always against a levi: have some backup with you.<br>
                <u>Raptor vs manta:</u> manta's can't shoot back so you can't really call this 
                a fight. Unfortunately, your missiles only lock on if you aim at the manta, 
                so you can't decently lead them, unless you get really close. Prim fire can 
                help, but is not very effective either.<br>
                <u>Raptor vs paladin:</u> Death from above! And the only thing they can do is 
                delaying it a bit. Just remember to keep moving, ok?<br>
                <u>Raptor vs raptor:</u> raptors can outrun the missiles at full speed, but 
                they can't outrun it when they're motionless. Try to avoid duels with raptors, 
                because it's too easy to keep outrunning the other vehicle's missiles. Prim 
                fire isn't an option either, because this can be avoided even easier.<br>
                You'll get a 'Top gun' award for shooting down a raptor while you're in a raptor<br>
                <u>Raptor vs scorpion:</u> just hit the thing from above. It can't escape<br>
                <u>Raptor vs SPMA:</u> as one of the fastest vehicles, it's your task to stop 
                them from launching airstrikes at your node/core.<br>
                <u>Raptor vs turret:</u> avoid armed turrets. If they hit you, you'll get knocked 
                back, which makes future hits even easier. Therefore, it's best to retreat and 
                rethink your strategy</p>

            <p>Scorpions are the karts from hell. With a web throwing gun and 2 blades on 
                the side, who wouldn't fear these constructions? Unfortunately, the answer is 
                <i>almost everyone</i>. The scorpion is pretty fast, but all the airborne vehicles 
                go faster, and your kart can't take shortcuts like these others do. </p>
            <p>Prim fire shoots bola's; a green beacon of slow-moving plasma that explodes 
                a couple seconds after impact. This explosion is pretty heavy, so if you can 
                wrap it against an enemy, they will feel it.<br>
                The couple seconds before explosion make it an ideal weapon for sneak attacks 
                against nodes: try to keep moving and use fixed aim to shoot directly at the 
                node. And as you can see in the damage chart: small bola's deal more damage/second, 
                so only charge up if you don't have a clean shot.</p>
            <p>Alt fire pulls out the blades on the side. These make your vehicle a lot harder 
                to handle and they break off if you hit anything besides a player, so only use 
                this if you're sneaking up on infantry.</p>
            <p>The scorpion is also a good choice to transport team mates around the map, 
                so check wether someone is heading your way before driving off. Note that these 
                players prevent you from throwing bola's, so they should get off your back whenever 
                you see a good target.</p>
            <p><u>Scorpion vs cicada:</u> this doesn't look good. With some luck you can outrun 
                their missiles, but mostly your best bet is to exit the vehicle while you still 
                can<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs goliath:</u> though it seems unlikely, but this can be an even 
                fight with the right foreknowledge. First of all, you must know where the tank 
                is before he sees you (take a detour if you have to). Second, the terrain must 
                be right: you must be able to get close to the tank before it can take a good 
                shot at you. Load up a big bola and release it as soon as you're sure to hit 
                him/her with it. Immediately start throwing small bola's at them. The only option 
                for the tank will be to shoot at you at point blank range and damage itself 
                in the process. This way, both vehicles will be destroyed...<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs hellbender:</u> stay at midrange distance; too far and you're 
                facing the cannon. Too close and the turret will take you out.<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs infantry:</u> the main key here is stealth. You can run them 
                over if they haven't seen you, but if they know you're coming, they'll jump 
                right over you. Don't forget to throw bola's when you're at close range.<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs leviathan:</u> simply impossible alone. Get away from there and 
                load up a big bola until backup arrives. At that moment you can start throwing 
                little ones at the thing. Try to reach the tank's back (it can't hit you that 
                good over there).<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs manta:</u> finally a <i>good</i> use for the scorpion! Bola's 
                get sucked into their wings, which will take out the manta (or the driver) in 
                a matter of seconds. You can even hassle manta's at midrange to long distance, 
                if you time your bola's correctly.<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs raptor:</u> running away should be your first priority; aiming 
                at it comes far second. Get out of your car if you have an AVRiL.<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs paladin:</u> firing small bola's quickly drain the shield, but 
                the paladin driver knows this too and you can be sure he'll fire a shot in your 
                direction.<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs scorpion:</u> one bola from another scorpion is enough to kill 
                you instantly, so get ready to leave the vehicle once you get covered with the 
                green stuff<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs SPMA:</u> load up a full bola and tangle the SPMA in it as soon 
                as you have a clear shot. Then finish up with a couple small ones. Just try 
                to keep your distance.<br>
                <u>Scorpion vs turret:</u> keep your distance; you won't survive long if you 
                get caught...</p>

            <p>Even before the SPMA (Self Propelled Mobile Artillery) made its entry on the 
                UT battlegrounds, it was nicknamed 'SPAM'. And with good reason, as there is 
                no way you can even remotely 'aim' with this weapon.<br>
                Basically, the SPMA is a long-range cannon that shoots bombs...at long range. 
                If these bombs are shot in an arc, they burst open into 5 others, each capable 
                of dealing about 250 damage when they rain down over the designated area. But 
                it's hard to predict just how these bombs are going to drop, so the chances 
                of succesfully dealing 1250 damage are close to zero. Don't worry: there are 
                some tricks to help you.</p>
            <p>First of all, there's the alt fire: this launches a camera that lets you view 
                the action from above (a second alt fire deploys the thing). By using your movement 
                keys, you can then choose the center of your bombardment. Note that a single 
                hit from any weapon can bring down your camera, and that infantry can even use 
                the camera to lock their AVRiL's on your vehicle, so make sure your time is 
                precious when the camera is in the air.<br>
                A second way to increase your chances of a hit is the distance to your target. 
                You have to make a decent arc to allow the bomb to burst open, but the lower 
                to the ground that this happens, the more concentrated the bombs will be.<br>
                Here is the ideal spot: shoot the camera, deploy it and bring the 'position 
                targeter' as close to your vehicle as possible. This is too close (the bombs 
                won't split), so move your targetter away for about half the size of the thing, 
                and you'll have the best spot to bomb down. It's always a bit trial and error 
                to find the best spot to bomb down a node, but scattered bombs can be just as 
                devastating if there are many enemies and/or vehicles in the area.</p>
            <p>But wait, there's more to this vehicle. Many people seem to forget that the 
                SPMA has about the same qualities as a hellbender (same armor and same top speed, 
                though it has lower acceleration). The second seat can be used to scare away 
                close infantry and you the skymines can be used to blast away a node at close 
                distance, just like a hellbender can.</p>
            <p>The main disadvantage to this vehicle is that it isn't made for combat against 
                other vehicles. It can fire skymine prim's against cicada's and raptors, but 
                most of the time, they will have an easy time with this thing. Goliaths and 
                leviathans <i>might</i> be possible to hit with your prim fire if you can calculate 
                your arc well, but it's still very unlikely to win this fight. Hellbenders are 
                somewhat a tie: you can't hit them, but they can't deal damage fast enough to 
                do stuff. Use the skymines for manta's, scorpions and infantry that come too 
                close, but don't hope to last long if they decide to stay at a distance.<br>
                Conclusion: avoid combat alltogether and go find yourself a decent camp spot 
                to spam stationary targets (nodes, turrets and deployed lev's).</p>

            <p>The stationary defence tool is not a vehicle, but still something to deal with. 
                There are many types of turrets, but the laser turret is by far the most common 
                one in onslaught. It has a basic trace-hit laser which deals a good amount of 
                damage and momentum, but spreads out a bit. It has the capacity to zoom in well 
                enough to notice anything hostile in the area.<br>
                When manning a turret your main goal isn't to kill opponents, but to keep them 
                out of the area. Some enemies will retreat when they get hit by a turret. If 
                so, let them go unless there aren't any other enemies around.</p>
            <p>If there are more enemies are attacking, make sure that you pick a slow moving 
                target. It's no use trying to hit a manta that avoids you while a tank is approaching 
                your position. Oh, and jump out if your health is getting too low.</p>
            <p><u>turret vs cicada:</u> this is your main target: the hit knocks them back, 
                so they can't target your node (or you).<br>
                <u>Turret vs goliath:</u> a good choice because goliaths can't avoid the damage. 
                Unfortunately: neither can you (two shots take out your turret, so leave the 
                thing after one hit)<br>
                <u>Turret vs hellbender:</u> most hellbenders won't stop until they arrive at 
                your node, and they usually make it that far...Still easy to target<br>
                <u>Turret vs infantry:</u> good infantry is hard to hit, so keep these guys 
                as last targets...but keep an eye on your armor<br>
                <u>Turret vs leviathan:</u> call for backup, but don't stop shooting: every 
                bit of damage on that thing counts<br>
                <u>Turret vs manta:</u> this looks more frightening than it is: manta's can 
                easily avoid being shot at (or at least getting pinned down by the knockback), 
                but they can be distracted from aiming at their targets...which is a good thing<br>
                <u>Turret vs paladin:</u> it takes too long to drain their shields, so keep 
                an eye out for better targets; this situation wont' happen much, because paladins 
                are better in defence<br>
                <u>Turret vs raptor:</u> not much armor and relatively easy to hit: a very good 
                target, and the most important one if the node doesn't contain AVRiL's.<br>
                <u>Turret vs scorpion:</u> not the best target there is, but certainly not the 
                worst. Knock them out of the area<br>
                <u>Turrer vs SPMA:</u> check the skies for their camera, and take it out as 
                soon as you notice anything. If you can <i>see</i> the SPMA, it's too close 
                to be a threat, so keep an eye for better targets.<br>
                <u>Turret vs turret:</u> ehm...blame the level designer?</p>
            <p>That's about it for duels. However, if there are more than 2 players on the 
                server (which is usually the case) you will get into more complex situations 
                that require more strategic thinking. I can't give you specific information 
                though, because with 11 different types of 'vehicles' (including infantry and 
                turrets) you have 11*11*11=1331 different situations...and that's just with 
                3 players being involved. Feel free to write your own guide about it if you 
                want to, but don't bother me with this request ;-)</p>
