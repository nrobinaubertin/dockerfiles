            <p class=quote>Ball carrier is here! - Aryss</p>

            <p>On numerous sites, I have seen people compare Bombing Run to Capture The Flag 
                or soccer. The truth is that it's neither. Simply <i>because</i> it combines 
                those 2 other games is BR completely on its own. That means that strategies 
                are completely non-transferrable. So prepare yourself for a new guide...this 
                isn't a rehash of some CTF forum or a football site.</p>
            <p>Bombing Run is the typical underdog gametype of UT2004. I know many players 
                whose favorite gametype is BR (including myself), yet the public servers are 
                still fairly empty, certainly when compared to CTF, DM, TDM and ONS. That's 
                a damn shame, if you ask me. It's fast, it's fun, it's easy to learn but hard 
                to master...just like all popular gametypes. Maybe the learning curve is set 
                too high for the average player to pick up? Well...then in that case, this guide 
                can help out, as I'm going to describe everything I have gathered until now. 
                This is version 2 of the guide; I updated it mid-January 2006...about 7 months 
                after the last addition. The main reason is that a clan mate opened up <a href="http://www.2k4bombingrun.com/">UT2k4 
                    Bombing Run PUG</a>, which - among others - showed 3 other BR guides. More than 
                enough reason to refresh my stuff and get rid of the names I invented earlier 
                (eg. 'pulling' is a better name than 'long range passing').</p>
            <h2><a name="Basics"></a>Basics</h2>
            <p>BR is a team game: each level has two bases with a goal in the end and a ball 
                that starts out in the center. The objective is to pick up the ball, infiltrate 
                the enemy base with it and either jump into their goal with it (gives your team 
                7 points), or shoot the ball into the thing (a mere 3 points). After a goal 
                is scored, a new round will start.<br>
                All players are equipped with a radar, which points out the direction of the 
                ball, and which team is carrying it (red, blue or neutral). Keep in mind that 
                this radar only points out the XY-axis; it doesn't show on which floor the ball 
                is currently at.</p>
            <p>If you are carrying the ball, things change a bit. First of all, you loose 
                all your weapons. You can only do 2 things:<br>
                <b>Prim fire:</b> shoots the ball. If the ball is unlocked, it will act like 
                a lighter variant of a flak grenade, falling down after some distance. If it 
                <i>is</i> locked on a teammate (see below), it will shoot straight toward this 
                player, like a guided missile.<br>
                Note: <br>
                <b>Alt fire:</b> tries to lock on to team members in front of you. Pressing 
                alt fire repeatedly cycles through potential passing candidates. If there are 
                no passing candidates in front of you, it will remove any lock you will have.</p>
            <p><b>Notes about the ball and its carrier:</b><br>
                -the ball carrier's health replenishes up to 100 at a rate of 5 health/second.<br>
                -if you are in posession of the ball, the radar points toward the enemies' goal 
                instead of to the ball<br>
                -if a pass hits a part of the level before it arrives at the one being passed 
                to, the ball will maintain its speed and bounces all over the place (can be 
                tricky to catch)<br>
                -if someone being passed to dies before he receives the ball, it will lose its 
                focus and fall down<br>
                -only 2 kinds of projectiles can affect a neutral ball: explosive ones (rockets, 
                flak) and shock ammo. It can't be moved before it's picked up from its original 
                pickup spot<br>
                -since UT2004, BR has the standard option of &quot;translocator draining&quot;. 
                This means that when you pass the ball, your translocator will be set to -1 
                (it will have to recharge twice before being able to translocate). Whenever 
                someone picks up the ball after that (eg. after a pass), the translocator ammo 
                is increased to 2.<br>
                -the ball will automatically reset once it falls in a death zone or isn't picked 
                up in 20 seconds.</p>
            <p>That's about it for the basics. Before continuing with the next chapter, you 
                should try out the gametype to the point where you know the levels. Even though 
                the AI of the bots is completely insufficient for decent BR games, it's certainly 
                prefered over getting online before you understand just how incredibly important 
                passing is in this game...</p>
            <h2><a name="Flow"></a>Dynamics of the online game</h2>
            <p>Done practicing? Good. Now, I want you to completely get rid of all memories 
                of how bots play. Just remember the layout of the maps with the key positions. 
                You're going to need these, because you've got to travel through the maps <i>fast</i>! 
                The opinions on how a 'real' BR match is played out differ, but if it involves 
                a translocator, you must be able to travel quickly with it. If needed, recheck 
                the page '<a href="movement.html#Translocator">Travelling with the translocator</a>' 
                for the basics. This will be crucial for the next part: teamplay.</p>
            <p>In online games, you work as a team. It's never &quot;<i>I scored a goal</i>&quot;; 
                always &quot;<i>my team scored a goal</i>&quot;...at least if you're trying 
                to win. Besides: personal credit for the goal is always split amongst everyone 
                who helped you. That brings us to the main point here: passing. Your average 
                BR game consists for nearly 50% of passing and getting in a good position to 
                receive a pass. The &quot;good position&quot; is basically nothing more than 
                being in an open, straight line somewhere in front of the ball carrier. Higher 
                positions work best for this, as long as the edge of the high position isn't 
                blocking the ball. So stand close to the edge and jump a bit to get the best 
                chances of completing a succesful pass. Note that the passing range isn't unlimited: 
                you've got a decent range and the receiver can keep moving away while the ball 
                is on its way, but the lock-on breaks once the distance is too big.<br>
                The idea of constant passing has two very important reasons. The main one is 
                speed: with a decent team, you can move the ball through the level quicker than 
                anyone can do by himself, even when that person would have unlimited translocator 
                ammo.<br>
                The other one involves the lifetime of the ball carrier. I remember someone 
                complaining that he always died a mere 2.5 seconds after picking up the ball. 
                There are no stats about this (that I know of), but 2.5 seconds is IMO about 
                the average lifetime of carriers. No wonder, since everyone on the server knows 
                the location of the ball. That's why it's called <b>bombing</b> run: hold on 
                to it for too long and you'll die. So pass it around. When I'm ballrunning, 
                I'm almost constantly clicking my right mouse until I've got a lock on someone 
                in front of me. I advise to do the same: they'll hear a beep at that moment, 
                so they should get into a good position to receive a pass ASAP (once again: 
                if they know what they're doing, they are probably already on their way to a 
                good position). After some practice matches of the gametype, you'll start to 
                develop an instinct for that &quot;last chance&quot; moment, usually foretold 
                by rocket fire or a shock bubble coming to you. That's when you use primary 
                fire, no matter whether you're locked on to someone or not (unless you've got 
                over 150 health, of course). As a ball carrier, your goal isn't to score the 
                goal; it's actually <i>to get the ball as close to the enemy goal as possible</i>.</p>
            <p>Let's take an example here. In the picture below, you are the ball carrier. 
                If you're on the red team, your teammembers should get to either position 1, 
                2 or 3. 1 is the best position, since it is more shielded from the rest of the 
                map. Nonetheless, you can expect enemies to appear on those blue spots (they 
                know these positions as well). So as long as there is no safe pass you can make, 
                you should keep moving. As you can see, the main intention is to survive by 
                keeping unpredictable rather than to get anywhere. Just keep on the lookout 
                for teammembers getting into position. Moving unpredictable isn't as easy as 
                it sounds. I have written some ideas about it down <a href="http://users.skynet.be/taleweaver/UT2004/movement.html#Quicksilver">here</a>, 
                but that's about as far as I can go. Keep practicing and you'll get the knack 
                for it.<br>
                If you were on the blue team, the situation looks about the same: you should 
                hope for the team to climb into positions A or B before too many reds will get 
                into the blocking positions (those pink crosses). </p>
            <p><a href="pics/BR_1.jpg"><img src="pics/BR_1.jpg" width="800" height="600" align="baseline" alt="BR-1" border="0"></a></p>
            <p>There are 3 ways to counter passes. The most obvious is to <b>take out the 
                    ball carrier</b>. These guys are the main target and rarely survive long. Gunning 
                them down with a spray weapon isn't the best option, though: because of the 
                continuous draining, ballrunners can usually do a last-second shot. Therefore, 
                use explosive weapons, or - better yet - hitscan.<br>
                It's often easier to <b>kill the ballrunner's passing opportunities</b>, since 
                they are busy doing stuff with their translocator. Once you know the level, 
                it's not too hard to predict where they are going.<br>
                The third - and hardest - method is to <b>stop the ball as it is being passed</b>. 
                Projectiles (mostly shock combos) can take out the ball lock. Also, getting 
                your body inbetween the ballrunner and the receiving party will quickly steal 
                the ball.</p>
            <p>Stopping a ballrush isn't always easy. If you manage it, you'll usually have 
                the surprise element for about 1 to 2 seconds to pick up the ball and run. Once 
                these seconds are expired, it's often better to create a spam zone. This means 
                you don't pick up the ball, but instead shoot at everyone who comes near. This 
                costs a lot of time in which both parties get closer to the ball. The bloodbath 
                that follows usually gets won by the team who'se base is closest by (even if 
                it is just by numbers instead of players).</p>
            <p>The whole team dynamic gets switched around once the ball changes ownership. 
                Suddenly, the ones in front of the ball have to turn 180 degrees, the ones behind 
                the ball have to be on the alert and the ball carrier itself...erm, is probably 
                coming back from the respawn point. The newly ball-controlling team has to reform 
                their group as well to start the offence. In either case, make sure the announcer 
                is enabled! There's no excuse for someone &quot;who didn't know the other team 
                controlled the ball&quot;.</p>
            <h2><a name="Roleplay"></a>Roleplay</h2>
            <p>As with any team game, players should take on different roles within the game. 
                However, with the speedy nature of this gametype, the role mostly depends on 
                the position of the players rather than on the skills. As a result, everyone 
                will pass through different roles, depending on the position in regard of the 
                ball. The roles do <i>not</i> revolve around positions of the map.</p>
            <p>Just as in soccer, the entire group has to keep moving. As long as the same 
                team is on offence, everyone should try to get ahead of the ball carrier, so 
                he has a maximum of potential passes he can make. In the (theoretical) ideal 
                case, he should be able to make a good pass every single second he's on the 
                move. Besides being in a good position, the ones in front of the ball (attackers) 
                have the second objective to clear out enemy resistance, or at least try to 
                seduce the enemy into choosing a target besides the carrier. As with all attackers 
                in this game, this role is the most likely to get you killed. That's where the 
                dynamics of the game kick in: attackers respawn behind the ball and start translocating 
                again to pick up a few weapons and catch up to the ball carrier. Meanwhile, 
                another wave of teammates who were behind the carrier (defenders) will have 
                moved ahead to take over the role of the fallen attackers. This kind of role 
                switching is routine within BR. A team that doesn't play like that will find 
                themselves being overrun in a short amount of time (and believe me: every team 
                with goal defenders got pushed seriously into defence).</p>
            <p><img src="pics/BR_2.jpg" width="293" height="379" align="left">Time for another 
                example (see picture).</p>
            <p><b>Player 1</b> has the ball. As seen in the previous chapter, your main priority 
                is to look out for passing opportunities. Player 3 is in a good spot, so he's 
                the first choice. If you can't get a clear shot for some reason (objects inbetween 
                are most likely), try to lock on to 2. If he is unable as well, try to keep 
                alive while A and C keep firing at you until you've got a better chance for 
                a pass. Even pass to 4 (backwards pass) if you have to: it's better to wait 
                longer and keep control of the ball than it is to loose that thing.</p>
            <p><b>Player 2</b> is pretty close to the ball carrier. If the terrain is right, 
                he should translocate closer to the goal while making sure he remains a valid 
                passing target for 1 (so don't turn corners at this stage). If A and C are really 
                making things hard on 1, it's also allowed to give cover to the ball carrier 
                (1 is most likely to pass to 3 anyway). The exception is when player 1 has a 
                lock on to player 2. If you get a lock-on, it <i>always</i> means &quot;get 
                ready to receive the pass&quot;</p>
            <p><b>Player 3</b> is in the best position to receive the pass. His main task 
                is to make sure he's able to receive the pass, by making sure there's no objects 
                blocking the path. A much lower priority task is to pick shots at A and B. He 
                can also use the translocator to remain alive long enough to receive the pass</p>
            <p><b>Player 4</b> is the defender (2 and 3 are attackers). He should use his 
                translocator to catch up to the ball. At this point, the specific situation 
                determines his action: since 2 and 3 are in the passing positions by now, and 
                1 can only pass to one player, it doesn't make much sense to get into an attacking 
                position as well. Giving cover to 1 is usually the better option in this scenario. 
                The fact that at this point, 1 is ballrunning for a longer time also indicates 
                that he might not survive much longer as well.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, <b>player A</b> is the main blocker for 1. Close range fire is the 
                quickest chance to kill someone <i>and</i> to steal the ball in the process. 
                As a bonus, he can somewhat use his own body to block shots going to 2 or 3. 
                The disadvantage - quick close range fire often leads to suicide - isn't that 
                much of a price to pay. As seen before, creating a spamzone where nobody controls 
                the ball is always better than allowing the other team to keep control of it.</p>
            <p><b>Player B</b> has to deal with player 3. He will be looking out for his position, 
                so you've got a small element of surprise. Use it wisely, but don't stop harassing 
                the guy until he is either dead or unable to receive the pass. About a second 
                before he receives the ball is often another good opportunity: he won't fire 
                since he doesn't want to bounce the ball, but he can't start running yet. Player 
                B also has to keep an eye out for 2. Practice yourself in shooting at translocators: 
                it often gets you easy kills, or at least prevents the players from getting 
                in good positions.</p>
            <p><b>Player C</b> will have to estimate things. If he has good hitscan, he might 
                shoot the ball carrier in the back. But if he knows the carrier will just pass 
                once he's about to die, it's better not to aim at the guy, but immediately translocate 
                ahead to assist B in clearing out the attackers.</p>
            <p><b>Player D</b> is in the completely wrong spot. This happens from time to 
                time, so don't worry. The only mistake you can make here is to avoid the brutal 
                fact that you can't catch up to the other team in time (relying on your team 
                to take back the ball is NOT a good idea). The solution? Suicide (make sure 
                you have <a href="commands.html#buttons">bound this to a key</a>). Yes, even 
                when you're at 199 health, 150 armor with all the weapons. Personal score isn't 
                important here; the only thing that matters is to try and stop the enemies from 
                scoring. It's included in the game for this reason and it's completely accepted 
                by anyone who knows the game. So don't hesitate, and don't regret when it turns 
                out they manage to take back the ball one second after you suicided. The chances 
                were just as good your help in the front line was crucial to turn the tide...</p>
            <p>If you understand everything at this point, you are ready for online gaming. 
                You've got what it takes to play the game and be useful to your team. As far

                    Bombing run PUG</a> also contains the IRC info for some Pickup Games. The remaining 
                chapters of this guide are further advanced lessons. They are great assets to 
                further improve your skills, but aren't essential to the game. Besides...by 
                playing online, you'll learn these fast enough because the regulars know most 
                - if not all - of these tricks.</p>
            <h2><a name="Advanced"></a>Advanced tactics</h2>
            <p><b>Changing the ball launcher crosshair: </b>all the weapons have different 
                crosshairs; the ball launcher is no exception. However, you can't edit it in 
                the <font color="#000080">Settings-Weapons</font> section; you'll have to manually 
                create the needed lines in <font color="#000080">\System\User.ini</font>. The 
                easiest way to do this is to first change a <i>different</i> weapon's crosshair 
                to fit the crosshair, color and scale one you would like to use for the ball 
                launcher. Then, in User.ini, search for the paragraph of the changed weapon 
                (<font color="#000080">XWeapons.&lt;weaponname&gt;</font> or <font color="#000080">onslaught.&lt;weaponname&gt;</font>) 
                and copy the lines underneath that start with &quot;CustomCrosshair&quot;. Proceed 
                by making a new paragraph called <font color="#000080">[XWeapons.BallLauncher]</font> 
                and paste the copied lines underneath. Finally, change back the croshair of 
                that other weapon back to normal.</p>
            <p><b>Resetting:</b> it's a common tactic to shoot the ball in a death zone to 
                get the ball back to the center. Most retail maps have a death zone near the 
                goal, so when a team is pulling a strong offense, defense often tries to reset 
                the ball. Though this gives some breathing room to the defending team, the attacking 
                team usually has the most chances of picking up the ball from the offense again 
                (the 'defenders' from the attacking team often anticipate this, either leaving 
                just their translocator there or even camping the place). Therefore, resetting 
                should only be done as an emergency. Every second of delay you can cause between 
                tossing the ball away and the actual reset increases the chance that both teams 
                have the same chance of getting the ball from the respawn point.<br>
                Bifrost, Disclosure, Skyline and Slaughterhouse have a &quot;death zone&quot; 
                goal, which will immediatelly reset the ball if a team shoots the ball in their 
                own goal. Anubis, Elecfields, Serenity and Twintombs all have a ravine nearby, 
                which also allows for the same thing. This just leaves BridgeOfFaith, Canyon, 
                Colossus and Icefields as the maps where a defending team must actually carry 
                the ball away from their goal zone.</p>
            <p><b>Blocking:</b> blocking is getting real close to the enemy ball carrier with 
                a flak cannon or shieldgun to prevent him/her to make a clean shot or pass. 
                There's a reasonable to good chance to block the carrier, based on your close 
                combat skills and your distance to the carrier. Keep in mind that some carriers 
                pass you the ball and immediately start shooting at you. Be prepared to put 
                the ball away instantly when this happens.</p>
            <p><b>Tossing (unguided shots):</b> when possible, a ball carrier should always 
                pass. If this can't be done for some reason, he should attempt to shoot the 
                ball in a high arc in the direction of the goal...at the last possible moment, 
                of course. This simple technique loses the ball for your team, but at least 
                it will take a few seconds before either team will be able to claim control 
                of the ball.</p>
            <p><b>Boosting (court shots):</b> this is a variant of tossing the ball. It's 
                fairly simple, actually: immediately after tossing the ball, you shoot at it 
                with the shock rifle's prim fire. This gives the ball a strong boost in the 
                fired direction (this is mainly useful in open maps, like Skyline or Colossus). 
                To do this, it's important to point out that ballrunners can still switch weapons. 
                The weapon they have selected will be the one they switch to as soon as they 
                toss or pass the ball.<br>
                Note: this is not to be confused with the UT2003 movement technique, also known 
                as boosting. </p>
            <p><b>Intercepting:</b> intercepting means you pick up the ball while it's in 
                the air. It goes from simply &quot;standing between the carrier and the attacker&quot; 
                to &quot;translocating to the spot in the air where the ball will come by&quot;. 
                Basic interception comes down to knowing where an attacker is when he or she 
                is about to receive a pass. If you're close to this attacker, you should start 
                harassing him while he has to wait to pick up the ball. If you're between the 
                two, you should try blocking the attacker's view of the carrier.<br>
                From time to time, you'll have to intercept tossed balls. This requires some 
                leading, which is best practiced offline (eg. by loading Skyline without bots, 
                time limit and translocator drain. Shoot the ball against the wall and pick 
                up the ball while it's still in the air).</p>
            <p><b>Goalie:</b> this is a last-ditch effort from the defending team: getting 
                in front of the goal, armed with a close combat weapon (even the shieldgun is 
                better than spray or hitscan weapons). The ball has to come through this point, 
                so one or two prepared defender can be a good choice here.<br>
                A common mistake on pub servers is that players seem to think that a continuous 
                goalie is needed (aka: a fulltime goal camper). This is wrong: by remaining 
                in that spot, the chances of a good offense are seriously lower since there 
                is someone missing -&gt; other players have to move quicker to keep up with 
                the dynamics of the game, which is NOT easy to do. As a result, the other team 
                will - on average - have more ball control and thus have more chances of scoring 
                after all.</p>
            <p><b>Defensive play:</b> this somewhat resembles the goalie thing, but isn't 
                quite the same. I've seen it happen quite some time that a team that has a certain 
                advantage over the other team will focus more on denying the other team the 
                ball rather than keeping up the control for themselves. This means that they 
                won't take as much daring passes, progress slowly with the ball (if at all) 
                and give more cover to the ball carrier. This kind of grind doesn't work on 
                every map, but it can lead to a situation where no further goals are scored...even 
                though the ball will more often be on the up-team's territory (the ball comes 
                closer to their goal, but the defense is harder than usual).</p>
            <p><b>ballpicking tricks:</b> the moment you pick up the ball, you automatically 
                release the fire for any weapon you had. If you were loading rockets, you better 
                not aim at the ground. If you were running around with a fully loaded goo gun, 
                you better not walk forward. It also allows you to make a shieldjump: hold prim 
                fire of the shieldgun and jump directly on top of the ball. You'll immediately 
                bounce back with it. With a little timing, it's even possible to shieldjump 
                to the pillars in Twintombs from the bomb respawn point.</p>
            <p><b><img src="pics/BR_3.jpg" width="481" height="238" align="right">Pulling 
                    (long range passing):</b> While receiving a pass, it is not required to stay 
                still. Add the possibilities of the translocator into the account and you've 
                got anadvanced manoeuver that covers ground quickly but is rather complex...both 
                to use and to explain. Take a look at the picture. It starts out simple: the 
                ball runner passes the ball to his team mate who is at position 1. However, 
                rather than waiting to receive the pass, the player tosses his translocator 
                out and waits. When the ball is close to him (at position 1), he translocates 
                to position 2. The ball still maintains the lock and starts a new, straight 
                line toward player 2. Meanwhile, the player throws his xloc again, and translocates 
                to position 3. The ball, which was at pos. 2 at that time, changes the trajectory 
                again and heads on to 3...<br>
                The whole idea of &quot;pulling&quot; the ball is IMO the most spectacular action 
                available in UT2004. There's a fair number of risks to the action, though. First 
                of all, there's the risk that the ball hits an object underway (such as the 
                edge between 1 and 2), in which case the ball loses the trajectory and bounces 
                all over the place at a serious velocity. The best way around this is to translocate 
                in the air (to position 2' ), so the ball will define a <i>curve</i> rather 
                than a straight line (the player will fall down, of course).<br>
                The second problem is the short pass distance: it can happen that you translocate 
                at the very moment you receive the ball. When this happens, the ball drops and 
                remains at the position. This might be caused by ping difference, but I'm not 
                so sure about it. In any case: the only certain way to avoid ball loss is not 
                to translocate once you suspect that the ball is too close by. This is a predicting 
                job, because at that point, you'll be facing the other way...<br>
                The final problem is with the long pass distance. The ball will loose its lock 
                when the target is too far away, and drop down as well. I'm not sure how long 
                this distance is, but it's certainly <i>longer</i> than the distance needed 
                for the ball runner to lock on to someone.<br>
                In theory, there is no limit on how far you can pull a ball. In practice, however, 
                long pulls with more than 2 translocations are rare.</p>
            <p><b>Assrunner:</b> alas, not everyone reads game guides before heading into 
                the pubs. It happens fairly often that you find people who start out entire 
                deathmatch campaigns, play sniper for the entire duration of the map, never 
                pass, dodge or use the translocator, and so on, and so on. The bad thing is 
                that fairly often, they aren't even bad players, so &quot;n00b&quot; simply 
                doesn't fit them. There is no real way around these guys: don't let them get 
                you down. Try to avoid them when giving passes and give them the best cover 
                you can give them when they have the ball...in any case, the opposite team won't 
                expect such convoy ;-) Finally: don't let player numbers distract you from what 
                team you should join. Just yesterday, someone on the server mentioned that &quot;it 
                was 5vs3&quot;, while there were in fact 11 or 12 players on the server.</p>
            <h2><a name="Level"></a>Level tactics</h2>
            <p>It's obvious that you can't make court shots in Disclosure, and that blocking 
                someone in Colossus is a rather...useless tactic. Playing BR in one map can 
                therefore differ like day and night from another map. Knowing the available 
                levels and acting by them is key if you want to avoid the ball to pass by you 
                unnoticed. In this chapter, I'll describe how to use parts of the level to your 
                advantage, just as well as how you can counter this abuse by the other team.</p>
            <p><b>Open ground:</b> this is the best terrain for passes. The ball-controlling 
                team must spread out and put the attackers on high terrain to allow for a good 
                pass. Defenders should act as in the example from the <a href="br_guide.html#Roleplay">Roleplay</a> 
                chapter.</p>
            <p><b>Narrow corridors:</b> passes are pretty hard to come by, especially if they 
                wind as well. Giving cover to the ball runner is important to keep the other 
                team at bay. These kind of areas often wind up in spamfests. Quickly search 
                for a different direction; pushing through in the same direction rarely gives 
                results: it takes long, so more defenders will show up at the location.</p>
            <p><b>Disarray:</b> this is abusing the radar...or rather, the lack of z-axis 
                notification on the radar. Mappers often put two different routes directly above 
                each other, allowing attackers to confuse the other team to their position. 
                Even hesitating (going back and forth on junctions of routes) makes things tricky 
                for the other team. This kind of feigning allows for both teams to get into 
                position, but the defending team will have it harder to be in the <i>right</i> 
                position.<br>
                Defense has to make good use of the trumps they have. Communication is the main 
                one: if the ball is near you on a such a position, tell your team mates. Even 
                simple keybinds like '<font color="#008040">Teamsay ^^^ Up ^^^</font>' and '<font color="#008040">Teamsay 
                    vvv Down vvv</font>' will do the trick. The radar will take care of the rest. 
                They also shouldn't forget that there is just one goal. Retreating to the goal 
                isn't the route to victory, but it's better than simply allowing the other team 
                to pass you by.</p>
            <p><b>Inbetween rounds:</b> after a goal, you have 10 seconds until the next round. 
                You can use it to type some comments and/or do some taunting to show your victory, 
                but there are better things to do. You don't lose your gathered inventory in 
                the next round (though effects like the adrenaline combo's and the damage amp 
                are gone). Therefore, it's best to gather up things...they'll always come in 
                handy. Otherwise, denying enemies extra gear by fragging them is also a good 
                option. Make sure to switch to the translocator by the time the countdown has 
                ended: the extra 0.5 second will be needed in the race...</p>
            <p><b>Superweapons &amp; power-ups:</b> when it comes to superweapons, I must 
                say I never played with them in BR. Both Jolt's as Crazy Uncle Bob's have superweapons 
                disabled, and I like it that way. Since a redeemer blast can easily take out 
                a moving team, it won't be long until half the server is <a href="predictions.html#Timing">timing</a> 
                the respawns.<br>
                Decent armor is different: after picking this up, you should be more careful 
                when attacking: try to keep as much of the armor, and you'll have an extra chance 
                of survival once you get the ball (about 2 or 3 seconds, if you're facing a 
                decent team).<br>
                Adrenaline is easily explained: you only need speed! Yes, it depletes faster 
                while carrying a ball, but a decent runner can make sure that he or she will 
                cover a (very) good distance in this time. Keep in mind that you don't gain 
                adrenaline as fast as in other gametypes (check charts <a href="items.html#Adrenaline">here</a>), 
                so be careful before using it. It's better not to activate the combo if there's 
                a chance you might die only seconds afterwards. Also, never start a combo before 
                you have the ball.</p>
            <p><b>Level tricks:</b> not all scenery is meant as eye candy. On roof A, there's 
                an opportunity to dodgejump to balcony B, attackers take positions on top of 
                meshes, and so on. Keep playing online, and you'll soon find out a whole lot 
                of them. Here are a some examples:</p>
            <p>-Anubis: attackers have a good (but dangerous) spot above the ball room entrance, 
                on top of the doorpost<br>
                -Bifrost: over 90% of the goals I've seen happened with a pass to someone on 
                the roof of the base. It's <i>a lot </i>faster than getting through the corridor.<br>
                -BridgeOfFaith: ball carriers who attack on the left bridge can do a running 
                dodgejump to the 2 med kits located at the end of the center bridge.<br>
                -Canyon: between the edge with the lightning gun and the goal is a big tree 
                on the right side. You can dodgejump onto the branches and from there to almost 
                directly on top of the goal jump pad<br>
                -Colossus: from above the air vents, you can drop down into the beam and get 
                pushed a whole lot closer to the goal. And on the other way, you can run over 
                the wires and dodgejump toward the goal side, ending up on top of the building.<br>
                -Elecfields: attackers should position themselves on the roofs; either the roofs 
                on the sides, somewhere above the center or on the roof of the small building 
                above the spawning point of the defenders<br>
                -Disclosure: the center is about the only place where you can pass the ball 
                around (eg. to a team mate on the lightning gun spot).<br>
                -Icefields: a lot of the snowy edges (including the snowy bridges) can be climbed 
                for better passing<br>
                -Serenity: attackers should take their position on top of the rocks facing the 
                reset point or on the bridge that mark the entrance of the bases<br>
                -Skyline: ball carriers should learn how to enter the goal room through the 
                side windows, or give a good pass to the attackers that make their way to the 
                top of the chimney, ready to shoot a straight 3-pointer. Defenders in the goal 
                room should be able to estimate the situation above, and block the chimney quick 
                enough to throw the ball off course.<br>
                -Slaughterhouse: if you're careful, you can walk on the metal plates that act 
                as fake ceiling in the meat storage room. At the end of this room, make sure 
                to pass the ball to a teammate that climbs the window.<br>
                -Twintombs: ball runners can dodgejump from their right roof onto the half arc 
                above the center, double jump to the opposite arc, then dodgejump to the opposite 
                roof.<br>
